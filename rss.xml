            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#x27;re visting this site directly, rather than via RSS, you may have noticed that I&#x27;ve updated the whole thing. It&#x27;s now built in Typescript, using Gatsby.js, and with Tailwind for the styling.</p><p>This site has been through several incarnations, going from flat HTML, to Wordpress, to Octopress, before in 2015 I settled on my own custom static site generator, built as a Grunt plugin. This worked fine and produced a performant, simple flat HTML site, but over the last few years I&#x27;d started to have issues with it:</p><ul><li>I haven&#x27;t used Grunt as a build tool for anything else since 2015, and it&#x27;s not as performant as more modern tools</li><li>I also don&#x27;t use Handlebars anymore, and that was the templating system I used for the site. These days React is my go-to and that makes a lot of dynamic functionality simpler</li><li>I also don&#x27;t use Bootstrap anymore, having dropped it for Tailwind, but that would be difficult to integrate with a Grunt-based workflow</li></ul><p>As such, for the last couple of years I&#x27;ve wanted to migrate off it for something more modern. Early on, Gatsby looked like the strongest candidate since it used React, offered a GraphQL-based abstraction layer for easier querying, had a rich ecosystem of plugins for common functionality, and was highly performant, but I made about three attempts to rebuild my site in it which petered out over time. Then, earlier this year I decided to start over and had a lot more success. I did struggle a bit getting a halfway decent design, and for a while pivoted to trying to build it with Next.js instead - this was ultimately abandoned because without the GraphQL abstraction layer, a lot of the querying became a real chore, but I did ultimately decide to port the appearance of that over to the Gatsby site.</p><p>One of the things that made this particular implementation the one that stuck was <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>. If you&#x27;re not familiar with it, it&#x27;s a superset of Markdown that lets you include JSX in your content, allowing for easy addition of reusable UI components within page and blog post content. Also, building it in Typescript was a good call - I&#x27;d been sticking with Flow for several years, but unfortunately it&#x27;s looking like Flow has fallen by the wayside and Typescript has become the only realistic typed solution for Javascript developers, so I felt it was time to adopt that. I&#x27;ve also enjoyed how easy Tailwind was to use (implementing dark mode was really simple), and have been able to implement JSON feeds as well as the standard RSS and Atom ones. Also, for the first time since I dropped Octopress, I now have the ability to add a title and highlight individual lines in code blocks.</p><p>I did have to make a few tough decisions about what to drop as well:</p><ul><li>These days I have a few issues with how AMP works, and the site is responsive and works well on mobile, so I decided to drop AMP entirely. The old AMP versions of pages redirect to their standard versions now.</li><li>Due to issues with creating dynamic RSS feeds in Gatsby.js, I decided not to port over the per-category RSS feeds.</li></ul><p>I have to admit, I&#x27;ve been neglecting posting on this site for a while, largely because I was working on this - it&#x27;s now nearly the end of July and this is my first post of the year - but now that I&#x27;ve got this done, I&#x27;m hoping I will be able to post more. One of my biggest motivations to do this has been that I&#x27;m particularly interested in doing more posts about React.js, and adopting MDX not only means that I can embed components in my posts, but I&#x27;ve also been able to integrate <code>react-live</code> into the site so I can embed editable examples in here too, which is potentially very powerful when demonstrating a concept.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when I used to work with Django, I read the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/lightweight-django/9781491946275/">Lightweight Django</a>, and it completely changed the way I thought about building web applications. For years I&#x27;d heard the same lines parroted about how Django was too large and bloated, and something like Flask was a better bet for many applications, and this book completely blew this misconception away. By demonstrating how it was possible to break the framework apart, use just what you need, and leave out what you don&#x27;t, it showed how I could benefit from my familiarity with Django, while making it more suitable for smaller applications.</p><p>Laravel, like Django, is a full stack framework, and is often subject to similar misconceptions about bloat. But just because the framework ships with all this stuff, doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re obliged to use it all. If you know you aren&#x27;t going to need all of a framework&#x27;s functionality, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you getting rid of what you don&#x27;t need, or even replacing it with something else. In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how to apply the same methodology to a Laravel application to remove what you don&#x27;t need. As part of this, we&#x27;ll be building a simple placeholder image service. This was used in Lightweight Django as it&#x27;s a good example of an application that is completely stateless, and doesn&#x27;t need sessions or a database, so it&#x27;s often seen as a bad fit for a full stack framework. Since the same applies here, it&#x27;s a good example for us too.</p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>Run the following command in the shell to create a new Laravel application:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">$ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel lightweight-laravel
</code></pre><p>What this actually does is as follows:</p><ul><li>Resolve the latest release of the package <code>laravel/laravel</code> that will work on your system</li><li>Copy it from the <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">repository</a> to the specified location</li><li>Carry out any post-install scripts specified, such as creating the <code>.env</code> file and generating a key</li></ul><p>However, that&#x27;s just a standardised boilerplate for Laravel applications. Most of the functionality of the framework is in the package <code>laravel/framework</code>, which is included as a dependency in your <code>composer.json</code>. This makes sense, because by keeping as much of the actual framework out of the starter boilerplate and in a separate repository, it minimises the work required to update the application to a new version. It also means you can strip that boilerplate down to remove references to things you don&#x27;t need, and even create your own custom boilerplates to save you work in future.</p><h2>Stripping down the boilerplate</h2><p>Let&#x27;s start stripping out the things we don&#x27;t need. Since our application is stateless, we have no need whatsoever of a database, so we can delete the <code>app/Models</code> and <code>database</code> folders. We&#x27;ll want to support Redis for the cache, so we can&#x27;t delete the file <code>config/database.php</code>, but we can remove any references to the database other than Redis from that file. We can delete some other files from the <code>config/</code> folder, namely <code>auth.php</code>, <code>broadcasting.php</code>, <code>filesystems.php</code>, <code>mail.php</code>, <code>queue.php</code>, <code>services.php</code> and <code>session.php</code>.</p><p>We also don&#x27;t need a lot of the middleware that ships with Laravel. If you go into the file <code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code> you&#x27;ll see that it assigns some middleware as global, some to the <code>web</code> and <code>api</code> groups, and some as optional route middleware. In this file:</p><ul><li>We don&#x27;t need to make any POST requests to this application, so we can lose the <code>ValidatePostSize</code> middleware from the global middleware entirely</li><li>The <code>web</code> group relates to cookies, sessions, CSRF, authentication and handling routing with substitute bindings. Since we don&#x27;t need any of that we can empty this group entirely</li><li>The <code>auth</code>, <code>auth.basic</code>, <code>can</code>, <code>guest</code>, <code>password.confirm</code>, and <code>verified</code> route middleware is also surplus to requirements and can go</li></ul><p>As this change is a bit fiddly, here&#x27;s a patch, which may be easier to read:</p><pre><code class="language-diff-php">From 6bc87e9602e839d5635963b6d740279b2dbcf16b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

</code></pre><p>These changes also mean a lot of the service providers and facades are now redundant and can be removed from the application. If you go into <code>config/app.php</code> you can remove <code>AuthServiceProvider</code>, <code>BroadcastServiceProvider</code>, <code>CookieServiceProvider</code>, <code>MailServiceProvider</code>, <code>NotificationServiceProvider</code>, <code>PaginationServiceProvider</code>, <code>PasswordResetServiceProvider</code>, <code>SessionServiceProvider</code> and <code>TranslationServiceProvider</code> from the providers section, as well as the commented-out local <code>BroadcastServiceProvider</code>. You can also delete the facades for <code>Auth</code>, <code>Cookie</code>, <code>DB</code>, <code>Eloquent</code>, <code>Gate</code>, <code>Lang</code>, <code>Mail</code>, <code>Notification</code>, <code>Password</code>, <code>Queue</code>, <code>Schema</code>, <code>Session</code>, and <code>Storage</code>.</p><p>Again, here&#x27;s a patch of the required changes:</p><pre><code class="language-diff-php">From 66be3b836706ef488b890cdae6e97d4fc6195dd6 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

2.28.0

</code></pre><p>There are a few service providers that ideally we&#x27;d strip out but are tightly integrated into the framework. For instance, the database and queue service providers are both used by some Artisan commands, and it&#x27;s not very practical to disable only those commands, so removing them will stop Artisan from working. If you don&#x27;t mind running the development server manually, you can go ahead and remove these.</p><h2>Building the application</h2><p>Now, let&#x27;s set out how our application will work. We will have two routes:</p><ul><li>A route that accepts width and height parameters in the route itself, and responds with a PNG response sized accordingly</li><li>A route that returns a simple HTML homepage</li></ul><p>You&#x27;ve no doubt seen various novelty placeholder sites like <a href="http://placekitten.com/">placekitten.com</a> for use in web projects, and this will be similar to that. We&#x27;ll use a simple black image with the dimensions in white text, but you should be able to use this as the basis of a more sophisticated placeholder service, such as if you wanted to use branded images for a particular client.</p><p>Since the home page will be fairly straightforward, let&#x27;s do that first. Delete the existing <code>resources/views/welcome.blade.php</code> file and save this to <code>resources/views/home.blade.php</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-html" metastring="title=resources/views/home.blade.php" title="resources/views/home.blade.php">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Laravel Placeholder Images&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;{{ mix(&#x27;css/app.css&#x27;) }}&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Laravel Placeholder Images&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This server can be used for serving placeholder
    images for any web page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To request a placeholder image of a given width and height
    simply include an image with the source pointing to
    &lt;b&gt;/image/&amp;lt;width&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;height&amp;gt;/&lt;/b&gt;
    on this server such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;
        &amp;lt;img src=&quot;{{ $example }}&quot; &amp;gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{{ route(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;, [&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; 50, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; 50]) }}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{{ route(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;, [&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; 100, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; 50]) }}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{{ route(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;, [&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; 50, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; 100]) }}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Note we&#x27;re using the <code>route()</code> helper to add some example images, even though it&#x27;s not in place yet. Add this route to your <code>routes/web.php</code> as well:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=routes/web.php" title="routes/web.php">Route::get(&#x27;/&#x27;, function () {
    return view(&#x27;home&#x27;, [
        &#x27;example&#x27; =&gt; route(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;, [&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; 50, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; 50]),
    ]);
});
</code></pre><p>Again, note that we&#x27;re using the <code>route()</code> helper to get the URL for the placeholder image. Next, we need to create the outline of the route for getting the placeholders:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=routes/web.php" title="routes/web.php">Route::get(&#x27;/placeholder/{width}x{height}&#x27;, function (int $width, int $height) {
})-&gt;where([&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;])
    -&gt;name(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;);
</code></pre><p>Due to the limited scope of this application, we won&#x27;t bother with full controllers, but you can add them if you wish. Note we&#x27;ve specified the name <code>placeholder</code> and set a regex to validate the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> parameters.</p><p>Now let&#x27;s populate the callback to generate a PNG file.</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=routes/web.php {2-13}" title="routes/web.php">Route::get(&#x27;/placeholder/{width}x{height}&#x27;, function (int $width, int $height) {
    if (!$img = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height)) {
        abort();
    }
    $textColour = imagecolorallocate($img, 255, 255, 255);
    imagestring($img, 1, 5, 5, &quot;$width X $height&quot;, $textColour);
    ob_start();
    imagepng($img);
    $file = ob_get_contents();

ul {

However, there are three potential issues:</p><ul><li>The images themselves are regenerated each time. Since they never change, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to cache them indefinitely for the best performance, and if we do need to change them in the future we can just flush the cache to resolve this</li><li>Similarly, we should use ETags to allow the application to tell the browser when the image has changed</li><li>There&#x27;s no limit on how large images can be, so a malicious user could request a huge image to break the system</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s tackle these in order. First, let&#x27;s create some middleware to handle the caching:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=app/Http/Middleware/CacheImages.php" title="app/Http/Middleware/CacheImages.php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

final class CacheImages
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Closure  $next
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        $key = sprintf(&quot;%d.%d&quot;, $request-&gt;width, $request-&gt;height);
        return Cache::rememberForever($key, function () use ($next, $request) {
            return $next($request);
        });
    }
}
</code></pre><p>We construct a cache key from the request width and height, and use the <code>Cache::rememberForever()</code> method to cache the response. We then register this middleware as route middleware in <code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=app/Http/Kernel.php {5}" title="app/Http/Kernel.php">    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        &#x27;cache.headers&#x27; =&gt; \Illuminate\Http\Middleware\SetCacheHeaders::class,
        &#x27;signed&#x27; =&gt; \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ValidateSignature::class,
        &#x27;throttle&#x27; =&gt; \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class,
        &#x27;cache.images&#x27; =&gt; \App\Http\Middleware\CacheImages::class,
    ];
</code></pre><p>And apply it to the image route:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=routes/web.php {16}" title="routes/web.php">Route::get(&#x27;/placeholder/{width}x{height}&#x27;, function (int $width, int $height) {
    if (!$img = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height)) {
        abort();
    }
    $textColour = imagecolorallocate($img, 255, 255, 255);
    imagestring($img, 1, 5, 5, &quot;$width X $height&quot;, $textColour);
    ob_start();
    imagepng($img);
    $file = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    return response()-&gt;make($file, 200, [
        &#x27;Content-type&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;image/png&#x27;
    ]);
})-&gt;where([&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;])
  -&gt;name(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;)
  -&gt;middleware(&#x27;cache.images&#x27;);
</code></pre><p>Next, let&#x27;s set ETags on our images. Laravel comes with the <code>cache.headers</code> middleware, which we can easily wrap around our placeholder route:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=routes/web.php {1,18}" title="routes/web.php">Route::middleware(&#x27;cache.headers:public;etag&#x27;)-&gt;group(function () {
    Route::get(&#x27;/placeholder/{width}x{height}&#x27;, function (int $width, int $height) {
        if (!$img = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height)) {
            abort();
        }
        $textColour = imagecolorallocate($img, 255, 255, 255);
        imagestring($img, 1, 5, 5, &quot;$width X $height&quot;, $textColour);
        ob_start();
        imagepng($img);
        $file = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        return response()-&gt;make($file, 200, [
            &#x27;Content-type&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;image/png&#x27;
        ]);
    })-&gt;where([&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;])
      -&gt;name(&#x27;placeholder&#x27;)
      -&gt;middleware(&#x27;cache.images&#x27;);
});
</code></pre><p>Finally, let&#x27;s handle the dimensions issue. Again, this is something that is probably best handled in middleware since that way it can be rejected before the point it gets to the route handler. All we need to do is to check to see if the width and height parameters exceed the intended value, and throw an error in the middleware:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=app/Http/Middleware/ValidateImageDimensions.php" title="app/Http/Middleware/ValidateImageDimensions.php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException;

final class ValidateImageDimensions
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Closure  $next
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        if ($request-&gt;width &gt; 2000 || $request-&gt;height &gt; 2000) {
            abort(422, &#x27;Height and width cannot exceed 2000 pixels&#x27;);
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Register this middleware in <code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=app/Http/Kernel.php {5}" title="app/Http/Kernel.php">    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        &#x27;cache.headers&#x27; =&gt; \Illuminate\Http\Middleware\SetCacheHeaders::class,

        &#x27;validate.images&#x27; =&gt; \App\Http\Middleware\ValidateImageDimensions::class,
    ];
</code></pre><p>And apply it to the image route:</p><pre><code class="language-php" metastring="title=routes/web.php {17}" title="routes/web.php">Route::middleware(&#x27;cache.headers:public;etag&#x27;)-&gt;group(function () {

        if (!$img = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height)) {
            abort();
        }
        $textColour = imagecolorallocate($img, 255, 255, 255);
        imagestring($img, 1, 5, 5, &quot;$width X $height&quot;, $textColour);
        ob_start();
        imagepng($img);
        $file = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        return response()-&gt;make($file, 200, [
            &#x27;Content-type&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;image/png&#x27;
        ]);
    })-&gt;where([&#x27;width&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;, &#x27;height&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;[0-9]+&#x27;])

      -&gt;middleware([&#x27;validate.images&#x27;, &#x27;cache.images&#x27;]);
});
</code></pre><p>And we&#x27;re done! We now have a basic, but functional, stateless Laravel application that&#x27;s been stripped of a lot of the unnecessary functionality. There are a few further changes that could be made to expand this if necessary, such as:</p><ul><li>Amend the project to allow requesting different image formats using an additional route parameter (hint - you&#x27;ll want to use something like <a href="http://image.intervention.io/">Intervention for this</a>)</li><li>Serve different images, either by using one as a starting template so they are all branded the same, or specifying one from several options in the URL, such as with <a href="https://www.placecage.com/">PlaceCage</a></li></ul><p>However, I will leave these as an exercise for the reader. The code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/lightweight-laravel">Github</a> if you get stuck at any point.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has given you some food for thought about how you can use Laravel for applications you might have previously considered too small to use it for. Don&#x27;t worry too much about removing something that you need to add later - version control means you can always retrieve it if it turns out you do need it later. I&#x27;d also add that potentially the same approach can be applied to other full stack PHP frameworks, though you&#x27;ll have to do some exploring on your own to determine this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I maintain a custom PHP legacy CMS for a client, and have also been building a micro-CMS as a learning project, so I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of time in the last few years thinking about how content should be managed, and how applications to manage it should work.</p><p>I&#x27;ve also at least tinkered with a few different content management systems down the years, and I&#x27;ve found it depressing how many times Wordpress has been the default choice, despite it being probably the worst CMS I&#x27;ve ever had the gross misfortune to use. The argument that &quot;it&#x27;s easy to install and use&quot; doesn&#x27;t really hold water given that in my experience most users setting up a new Wordpress site don&#x27;t go through the five-minute install, but use their shared hosting provider&#x27;s setup wizard, which typically also supports several other content management systems. Also, it just does not make sense to optimise a short five minute install that will never be repeated for that site over the rest of the workflow for maintaining the site, possibly for years - I&#x27;d rather have something that takes a bit more time to do the initial set up, but is easier to maintain.</p><p>So, what do I want in a PHP CMS? Here&#x27;s my thoughts on my ideal CMS solution.</p><h2>Managed entirely with Composer</h2><p>Creating a new site using a CMS should be as simple as running something like the following command:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">$ composer create-project --prefer-dist my/cms newsite
</code></pre><p>And updating it should be as simple as running the following:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">$ composer update
</code></pre><p>Installing a plugin should be a case of running this:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">$ composer require my/plugin-foo
</code></pre><p>It should then be possible to activate the plugin simply by listing it in a config file.</p><p>As far as possible, <em>all</em> of the functionality of the CMS should be contained in a single &quot;core&quot; package, and plugins should be their own Composer packages that can be installed, and then switched on and off in a simple config file. The initial creation step should be a case of checking out a boilerplate that contains only the absolute minimum - a front controller, a starting configuration, front end tooling, and some views - and gets the rest of the functionality from the core package.</p><h2>Allow creating custom site boilerplates</h2><p>It should be possible to create and publish alternative boilerplates.</p><p>For instance, if a CMS provides a default starting boilerplate that ships with Bootstrap, VueJS and Laravel Mix, I should be able to fork it, replace Bootstrap with Tailwind and Vue with React, and then use my version for future projects without having to spend a lot of time maintaining the fork.</p><p>Similarly, if there are certain plugins I use all the time, it should be possible to include those plugins as dependencies in my <code>composer.json</code> so that when I create a new project from my boilerplate, they&#x27;re present right from the start and I don&#x27;t have to faff around downloading and configuring them manually.</p><h2>Plugin API should work like a framework</h2><p>The best practices we&#x27;ve all spent years learning shouldn&#x27;t go out the window when working with a CMS. A good CMS should feel familiar if you&#x27;ve got some experience working in MVC frameworks, and it should embrace PSR standards. Adding a route should largely be a matter of writing a controller, mapping it to a route, and adding a view file, just as it would be in a framework</p><p>There&#x27;s always going to be some things that need to be CMS-specific, because registering things like routes is more complex in a general purpose CMS than a custom web app as they can be defined in multiple arbitrary places. These can be handled by triggering events at various points in the CMS application&#x27;s lifecycle, so that plugin authors can set up listeners to do things such as register routes, add new view helpers and so on.</p><h2>Focused exclusively on content, not presentation</h2><p>I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that the ability to amend presentation in a CMS is a misfeature. The purpose of a CMS is to manage content, not presentation, and making it able to amend presentation potentially gives unskilled site owners enough rope to hang themselves with, while making it actively harder for us devs.</p><p>I&#x27;ve certainly seen enough sites that a client has completely messed up after being given access to change the presentation in Wordpress, and because it&#x27;s stored in the database it&#x27;s not possible to roll back the changes easily the way it would be if the styling was stored in version control. And it&#x27;s definitely quicker for an experienced front end developer to edit a CSS file than to use Wordpress&#x27;s own tools for amending styling.</p><h2>Use a proper templating system</h2><p>As a templating language, PHP <em>sucks</em>:</p><ul><li>It&#x27;s too easy to overlook escaping variables properly</li><li>Handling partials is difficult</li><li>There&#x27;s always the temptation to put in more logic than is advisable in the view layer, especially when deadlines are tight</li></ul><p>Using a dedicated templating language, rather than a full programming language, in the view layer, means that entire classes of issues can be completely eradicated from the layer of the application that the developers who work with the CMS have the most dealings with. Developers are forced to move more complex logic into dedicated helpers, and can&#x27;t just leave it in the template &quot;until we have time to clear it up&quot;, which is often never.</p><p>Twig is solid, reliable, fast, easy to extend, and similar enough to other templating languages such as Handlebars and Django&#x27;s templates that if you&#x27;ve used any of those you can adapt easily, and it should probably be your first choice. Blade is also a solid choice, and if you want something whose syntax is not dissimilar to PHP you should probably consider Plates.</p><h2>Configuration with version control in mind</h2><p>Wordpress does this particularly badly because it actively encourages storing sensitive data, such as database credentials, in a PHP file (which is then kept in the web root...). A good, solid way to store configuration details in PHP is to store generic details (for instance, a list of the active plugins, which will be the same for production and the local copy developers run) for that project in either a YAML or PHP file, and store install-specific details in either a <code>.env</code> file, or as environment variables.</p><h2>Custom content types</h2><p>It should be easy to create a new content type, and define specific fields for that content type. For instance, if I&#x27;m building a recipe site, I should be able to define a Recipe type that has the following attributes:</p><ul><li>Ingredients</li><li>Cover image</li><li>Title</li><li>Method</li></ul><p>Then all Recipe instances should have those attributes, and it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to bastardise a different content type to make it work properly. It should also be possible to lock down the ability to create custom content types so it&#x27;s either limited to admins, or they&#x27;re defined in code, so end users can&#x27;t create arbitrary content types.</p><h2>Custom taxonomies</h2><p>It should be possible to define your own custom taxonomies for content. Continuing the Recipe example above, we should be able to define three sorts of taxonomy:</p><ul><li>Dietary requirements (eg vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free etc)</li><li>Meal (eg breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)</li><li>Region (eg Indian, Chinese, Italian)</li></ul><p>A taxonomy should be appropriately named, and again it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to abuse generic categories and tags to categorise content. As with the content types, it should also be possible to lock them down.</p><h2>A better solution than rich text for managing content</h2><p>Rich text is not a great solution for more complex page layouts, and tends to be abused horribly to do all sorts of things. There&#x27;s a tendency to dump things like snippets for Google Maps, tables, galleries, Javascript widgets and many more into rich text. This means that it also loses the semantic value of the content - rather than being a paragraph, then a map of the local area, then a photo carousel, then another paragraph, it&#x27;s just a single blob of text. This can&#x27;t be easily migrated to another solution if, say, you decide to swap Google Maps for Open Streetmap, and change one carousel for another, without going through and manually replacing every map and carousel, which is a chore.</p><p>Wagtail isn&#x27;t a PHP CMS, but <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/rich-text-fields-and-faster-horses/">it has an interesting approach to rich text handling</a> for complex content, inspired by <a href="https://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/">Sir Trevor</a>, based around blocks of different types. The Gutenberg editor in Wordpress 5.0 and up isn&#x27;t a million miles away from this, either. For simpler sites, it&#x27;s probably better to limit users to a Markdown editor and add helpers for adding more complex functionality directly in the template, such as a gallery helper.</p><h2>A decent command-line runner</h2><p>There are always going to be certain tasks that are best done from the command line. A decent CMS should have a command line tool that:</p><ul><li>Allows appropriate admin tasks, such as going into maintenance mode and flushing caches, to be done from the command line</li><li>Can be easily extended by plugin authors to add their own commands</li><li>Assists developers when working locally, such as by generating boilerplate when necessary (so, for instance, you can run a command to generate the skeleton for a new plugin)</li></ul><p>There&#x27;s no excuse not to do this when building a CMS. Symfony&#x27;s console component is solid, easy to work with, and a good base for whatever commands you need to write.</p><h2>Headless as an option</h2><p>The rise of headless CMS&#x27;s, both as a service and as software packages, hasn&#x27;t surprised me. Nowadays it&#x27;s quite common to have to publish the same content to multiple channels, which might be one or more websites, as well as mobile apps, and it makes sense to be able to centralise that content in one place rather than have to copy it in some fashion.</p><p>It&#x27;s therefore very useful to have an API that can retrieve that content for republishing. The same API can also be used with Javascript libraries like React and Vue to build sophisticated frontends that consume that data.</p><h2>Which solutions do this best?</h2><p>You&#x27;ll probably have got the idea at this point that Wordpress isn&#x27;t my first choice. It was created in a different era, and hasn&#x27;t kept up well compared to many of its contemporaries, and there are many technical issues with it that are at this point effectively impossible to ever fix. For instance, you could potentially store the post meta in the same table as the rest of the post data by using a JSON field in current versions of MySQL, which would make it more performant, but it seems unlikely it could ever be migrated across to use that solution.</p><p>Frustratingly, its mindshare means it&#x27;s erroneously seen as some kind of &quot;gold standard&quot; by inexperienced developers and non-technical clients, and there seems to be a common misconception that it&#x27;s the only solution that lets users update the content themselves (when in fact that&#x27;s the whole point of ANY CMS). Using Bedrock and a theme system like Sage that supports a proper templating system helps solve some of the problems with Wordpress, but not all.</p><p>I have tried a few solutions that come very close to what I want:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bolt.cm/">Bolt</a> seems from what I&#x27;ve seen so far to be effectively a &quot;better Wordpress&quot; in that the interface and functionality is broadly familiar to anyone already used to Wordpress, but it uses Twig, is built in Symfony, and has a proper command-line runner. I haven&#x27;t tried it since version 4 was released a few days back, so I will probably give it a spin before long.</li><li><a href="https://getgrav.org/">Grav</a> looks like a great solution for brochure sites. I&#x27;ve long thought that these sites, which often run on shared hosting, don&#x27;t really need a database-backed solution, and a flat-file solution is probably a better bet in most cases. Grav is simple to set up and configure, has a decent admin interface, and uses Twig for the views, making it easy to theme.</li><li><a href="https://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> is my current favourite and ticks almost all of the boxes mentioned above. It&#x27;s built on Laravel, and can be added to an existing Laravel site if required. It also allows you access to the full power of the underlying framework if you need it, and ships with a decent front-end boilerplate that includes Tailwind. The only downside compared to Wordpress is that it&#x27;s a paid-for solution, but the price is entirely reasonable, and if it&#x27;s for a client build you&#x27;ll not only save on all the premium plugins you don&#x27;t need, but you&#x27;ll probably save time on the site build.</li></ul><p>Payment shouldn&#x27;t be an issue if you&#x27;re doing client work, unless the cost is huge. You&#x27;re getting paid for building something, and if buying an off-the-shelf product saves you time, it&#x27;s well worth it. Back when Laravel Nova was first released, a lot of people were complaining that it wasn&#x27;t free, but that was neither here nor there - the cost is only equivalent to a few hours of an experienced developer&#x27;s time, and it would take a lot longer to build out the same functionality, and the same is true of any half-decent CMS. In the early days of the web, one company I used to work for sold <a href="http://www.wordserver.co.uk/">a CMS that was considered cheap by the standards of the time</a> at £495, plus £96 a year, for the entry level version - Statamic is significantly cheaper than that.</p><p>It&#x27;s always a good idea to be aware of the various CMS options around. Wordpress isn&#x27;t a great solution and there are plenty of options that are technically better, easier to use, more secure, and work out cheaper when you consider the total cost of ownership. I&#x27;ll probably be favouring Statamic for the foreseeable future when building content-based websites, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t look elsewhere from time to time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of type systems in general. Using Psalm to find missing type declarations and incorrect calls in PHP has helped me out tremendously. However, I&#x27;m not a big fan of Typescript. The idea of creating a whole new language, primarily just to add types to Javascript, strikes me as a fundamentally bad idea given how many languages that compile to Javascript have fallen by the wayside. Flow seems like a much better approach since it adds types to the language rather than creating a new language, and I&#x27;ve been using it on my React components for a good while now. However, there are a few edge cases that can be difficult to figure out, and one of those is any generic AJAX component that may be reused for different requests.</p><p>A while back I wrote the following custom hook, loosely inspired by axios-hooks (but using the Fetch API) to make a query to a GraphQL endpoint:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript" metastring="title=useFetch.js" title="useFetch.js">import { useCallback, useState, useEffect } from &quot;react&quot;;

function useFetch(url, query) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(false)

  const fetchData = useCallback(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);
    fetch(url, {
      method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,
      headers: {
        &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,
        &#x27;Accept&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({query: query})
    }).then(r =&gt; r.json())
      .then((data) =&gt; {
        setData(data.data);
        setLoading(false);
        setError(false);
      });
  }, [url, query]);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetchData();

</code></pre><p>When called, the hook receives two parameters, the URL to hit, and the query to make, and returns an array that contains a function for reloading, and an object containing the following values:</p><ul><li><code>loading</code> - a boolean that specifies if the hook is loading right now</li><li><code>error</code> - a boolean that specifies if an error has occurred</li><li><code>data</code> - the response data from the endpoint, or null</li></ul><p>Using this hook, it was then possible to make an AJAX request when a component was loaded to populate the data, as in this example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript" metastring="title=App.js" title="App.js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

However, it&#x27;s difficult to type the value of <code>data</code> correctly, since it will be different for different endpoints, and given that it may be reused for almost any endpoint, you can&#x27;t cover <em>all</em> the acceptable response types. We need to be able to specify the response that is acceptable in that particular context.</p><h2>Generics to the rescue</h2><p>Flow provides a solution for this in the shape of <a href="https://flow.org/en/docs/types/generics/">generic types</a>. By passing in a polymorphic type using <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> in the function declaration, we can then refer to that type when specifying what <code>data</code> should look like:</p><pre><code class="language-flow" metastring="title=useFetch.js {4-11}" title="useFetch.js">//@flow
import { useCallback, useState, useEffect } from &quot;react&quot;;

function useFetch&lt;T&gt;(url: string, query: string): [{

  loading: boolean,
  error: boolean
}, () =&gt; void] {

  const [loading, setLoading]: [boolean, ((boolean =&gt; boolean) | boolean) =&gt; void] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError]: [boolean, ((boolean =&gt; boolean) | boolean) =&gt; void] = useState(false)

  const fetchData = useCallback(() =&gt; {

};

export default useFetch;
</code></pre><p>Then, when calling the hook, we can define a type that represents the expected shape of the data (here called <code>&lt;Data&gt;</code>), and specify that type when calling the hook, as in this example:</p><pre><code class="language-flow" metastring="title=App.js" title="App.js">//@flow
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

</code></pre><p>That way, we can specify a completely different shape for our response data every time we call a different endpoint, without creating a different hook for every different endpoint, and still enjoy properly typed responses from our hook.</p><p>Generics can be useful for many other purposes, such as specifying the contents of collections. For instance, if you had a <code>Collection</code> object, you could use a generic type to specify that any one instance must consist of instances of a given type. Flow would then flag it as an error if you assigned an item of the wrong type to that collection, thus making some unit tests redundant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago I posted <a href="https://matthewdaly.co.uk/blog/2018/01/12/creating-a-caching-user-provider-for-laravel/">this article</a> about constructing a caching user provider for Laravel. It worked, but with the benefit of hindsight I can now see that there were a number of issues with this solution:</p><ul><li>Because it extended the existing Eloquent user provider, it was dependent on the internals of that remaining largely the same - any change in how that worked could potentially break it</li><li>For the same reason, if you wanted to switch to a different user provider, you&#x27;d need to add the same functionality to that provider, either by writing a new provider from scratch or extending an existing one</li></ul><p>I&#x27;ve used the decorator pattern a few times in the past, and it&#x27;s a good fit for situations like this where you want to add functionality to something that implements an interface. It allows you to separate out one part of the functionality (in this case, caching) into its own layer, so it&#x27;s not dependent on any one implementation and can wrap any other implementation of that same interface you wish. Also, as long as the interface remains the same, there likely won&#x27;t be any need to change it when the implementation that is wrapped changes. Here I&#x27;ll demonstrate how to create a decorator to wrap the existing user providers.</p><p>If we only want to cache the <code>retrieveById()</code> method, like the previous implementation, the decorator class might look something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Auth;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository;

final class UserProviderDecorator implements UserProvider
{
    /**
     * @var UserProvider
     */
    private $provider;

    /**
     * @var Repository
     */
    private $cache;

    public function __construct(UserProvider $provider, Repository $cache)
    {
        $this-&gt;provider = $provider;
        $this-&gt;cache = $cache;
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function retrieveById($identifier)
    {
        return $this-&gt;cache-&gt;remember(&#x27;id-&#x27; . $identifier, 60, function () use ($identifier) {
            return $this-&gt;provider-&gt;retrieveById($identifier);
        });
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function retrieveByToken($identifier, $token)
    {
        return $this-&gt;provider-&gt;retrieveById($identifier, $token);
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function updateRememberToken(Authenticatable $user, $token)
    {
        return $this-&gt;provider-&gt;updateRememberToken($user, $token);
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function retrieveByCredentials(array $credentials)
    {
        return $this-&gt;provider-&gt;retrieveByCredentials($credentials);
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function validateCredentials(Authenticatable $user, array $credentials)
    {
        return $this-&gt;provider-&gt;validateCredentials($user, $credentials);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>It implements the same interface as the user providers, but accepts two arguments in the constructor, which are injected and stored as properties:</p><ul><li>Another instance of <code>Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider</code></li><li>An instance of the cache repository <code>Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository</code></li></ul><p>Most of the methods just defer to their counterparts on the wrapped instance - in this example I have cached the response to <code>retrieveById()</code> only, but you can add caching to the other methods easily enough if need be. You do of course still need to flush the cache at appropriate times, which is out of scope for this example, but can be handled by model events as appropriate, as described in the prior article.</p><p>Then you add the new decorator as a custom user provider, but crucially, you need to first resolve the provider you&#x27;re going to use, then wrap it in the decorator:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\AuthServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider;
use Auth;
use Illuminate\Auth\EloquentUserProvider;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository;
use App\Auth\UserProviderDecorator;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * The policy mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $policies = [
        &#x27;App\Model&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;App\Policies\ModelPolicy&#x27;,
    ];

    /**
     * Register any authentication / authorization services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        $this-&gt;registerPolicies();

        Auth::provider(&#x27;cached&#x27;, function ($app, array $config) {
            $provider = new EloquentUserProvider($app[&#x27;hash&#x27;], $config[&#x27;model&#x27;]);
            $cache = $app-&gt;make(Repository::class);
            return new UserProviderDecorator($provider, $cache);
        });
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Finally, set up the config to use the caching provider:</p><pre><code class="language-php">    &#x27;providers&#x27; =&gt; [
        &#x27;users&#x27; =&gt; [
            &#x27;driver&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;cached&#x27;,
            &#x27;model&#x27; =&gt; App\Eloquent\Models\User::class,
        ],
    ],
</code></pre><p>This is pretty rough and ready, and could possibly be improved upon by allowing you to specify a particular provider to wrap in the config, as well as caching more of the methods, but it demonstrates the principle effectively.</p><p>By wrapping the existing providers, you can change the behaviour of the user provider without touching the existing implementation, which is in line with the idea of composition over inheritance. Arguably it&#x27;s more complex, but it&#x27;s also more flexible - if need be you can swap out the wrapped user provider easily, and still retain the same caching functionality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;ve always been a big fan in general of tools that provide feedback about the quality of my code. The development role in which I spent the most time was one in which I had no peer feedback or mentoring at all, and while I could definitely have done with more peer review than I had, automated tools helped fill the gap a little bit. When I started building my first Phonegap app, about a year after I started programming professionally, it used <em>far</em> more Javascript than I&#x27;d ever used before, and JSLint was very helpful in instilling good practices at that early stage in my career.</p><p>In addition, I often find that using an automated tool largely eliminates the issue of ego - if your colleague Bob tells you something is a bad practice, you can potentially dismiss it as &quot;That&#x27;s just Bob&#x27;s preferences&quot;, whereas an automated tool is potentially much more objective. Nowadays, my typical set of static analysis tools on a project includes:</p><ul><li>ESLint</li><li>Flow</li><li>PHP CodeSniffer</li><li>Psalm</li></ul><p>However, I&#x27;m always dubious of using any static analysis tool that&#x27;s tightly integrated with a particular editor or IDE. In this post, I will explain my reasoning.</p><h2>In-editor feedback</h2><p>Having instant feedback on the quality of your code is tremendously useful. Sure, you can run something like CodeSniffer from the command line and see what the problems are, but that&#x27;s nowhere near as useful as having it actually <em>in</em> your code. If you work on a legacy code base, there&#x27;s no way in hell you can wade through a long list of output in the terminal and fix them without losing the will to live. By comparison, actually seeing something flagged as an error where it actually occurs makes the mental cost of fixing it much smaller - you can see it in context, and can usually therefore resolve it more easily.</p><p>However, that doesn&#x27;t explicitly require that any one tool form an integral part of the editor. Most editors can hand off linting and static analysis to other, standalone tools, and doing so offers the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Less dependence on a given development environment - it&#x27;s always a struggle if you wind up stuck using a development environment you dislike (I grew to utterly despise Netbeans in my first role), but if you can use generic feedback tools that can be integrated with just about any editor, your team can use the development environment that suits them most, while still all benefiting from the feedback these tools provide</li><li>These tools tend to be open source, meaning you have the security of knowing that if the creator ceases maintaining it, either someone else may pick up the baton, or you can choose to fork it yourself. If a commercial IDE provider ceases trading, it&#x27;s likely you won&#x27;t be able to use their offering at all at some point in the future.</li></ul><p>Nowadays I use vim-ale in Neovim, and that provides real-time feedback for a number of linters and static analysis tools, including all those I mentioned above. I have comprehensive information on any issues in my code, and because any configuration is in simple text files that form part of the repository, it&#x27;s easy to update those settings for all developers working on the project to ensure consistency.</p><p>It&#x27;s possible that an integrated solution <em>might</em> offer a few advantages in terms of tighter integration with autocompletion and other functionality allowing for it, but whether they outweigh the tradeoffs mentioned here is dependent entirely on the implementation and how useful it is for any one team.</p><h2>Continuous integration to the rescue</h2><p>There&#x27;s another issue I have with this sort of tightly integrated static analysis, which is probably the biggest, and that is that the feedback is available only at the level of an individual developer, not the team.</p><p>It&#x27;s great providing all this feedback to developers, but what if they just ignore it? Not all developers have had the sort of experience that leads one to really appreciate the value of coding standards and type hints, particularly if they&#x27;ve worked primarily on small or greenfield projects, or in environments where the emphasis was on churning out large quantities of work, and getting developers to tidy up the sort of issues these tools identify can sometimes be a tough sell when faced with code which, at least superficially, works.</p><p>Suppose you take on a new developer and ask them to work alone on a particular project for several months. Due to your own workload you can&#x27;t easily schedule code reviews with them, so you don&#x27;t see what they&#x27;re writing until they&#x27;re done. Then you take a look at what they&#x27;ve written and it&#x27;s full of issues that the IDE caught, but the developer either didn&#x27;t bother to fix, or didn&#x27;t know how to. What they&#x27;ve done may well work, but they&#x27;ve introduced a huge morass of technical debt that will slow down future development for the foreseeable future.</p><p>If your static analysis tools work only in the context of a given editor or IDE, then if the new dev introduce issues in the code base and doesn&#x27;t resolve them because they don&#x27;t know how, or don&#x27;t see the value, then the first you knows about it is when you clone the repo yourself and open it up. With a solution that runs in a CI environment, you can catch any reduction in code quality when it&#x27;s pushed. Sure, code reviews can do that too, but that requires manual input in a way that not every team is willing to spare, whereas a CI server, once set up, is largely self sustaining. And you could run one tool locally and another in a CI environment, but you can&#x27;t be sure they&#x27;ll necessarily catch all the same issues.</p><p>Now consider the same scenario if you&#x27;re using a separate code quality tool that&#x27;s integrated both into the editor, and your continuous integration workflow. Obviously, it will depend on your personal CI setup, but once code quality either begins to drop, or drops below a given level, the CI server will mark the build as failed, and you&#x27;ll be alerted. You can therefore then raise the issue with the new dev before it gets out of hand, and provide whatever support they need to resolve the problem there and then.</p><p>I personally maintain a legacy project in which, at one point prior to my arrival, a junior dev introduced an enormous amount of technical debt after working on it alone for six months. An integrated linter or static analysis tool probably wouldn&#x27;t have stopped that from happening, for the reasons stated above, but if a similar tool were part of the CI workflow, it could have been flagged as an issue much earlier and dealt with. Yes, leaving a junior dev unsupported and unsupervised for that length of time isn&#x27;t a great idea, but it happens, particularly in busy environments such as agencies. A good CI setup lets you see if someone is adding these kinds of issues, and act to nip it in the bud before it becomes too much of a problem, which is ultimately good for that developer&#x27;s career.</p><p>Peer pressure can also be a strong motivating factor under these circumstances. By simply displaying a metric, you encourage people&#x27;s natural competitiveness, so displaying code quality stats in your CI dashboard will encourage your team to do better in this regard, and no-one wants to be visibly seen to be letting the team down by producing substandard code.</p><p>For these reasons, where possible for feedback on code quality, I would always prefer to rely on a standalone tool that can be integrated with an editor, or used as part of a continuous integration workflow, as opposed to any IDE-specific functionality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The digital agency I work for specialises in marketing, so some of my work tends to relate to mailing lists. This week I was asked to look at an issue on a Laravel-based export system built by a co-worker who left a few months ago. This particular application pulled data from the Campaign Monitor API about campaigns, and it returned the data as instances of <code>stdClass</code>, something that I&#x27;m not terribly happy about.</p><p>Now, this was an implementation detail of the Campaign Monitor PHP SDK, which is old and creaky (to say the least...) and doesn&#x27;t exactly abide by modern best practices. However, the legacy application I maintain also does this (there&#x27;s a <em>lot</em> of stuff that needs sorting out on it, and sadly replacing the <code>stdClass</code> instances is a <em>long</em> way down the list), so I thought it was an interesting subject for a blog post. I consider using <code>stdClass</code>, even just as a dumb container for data, to be an antipattern, and I thought it would be useful to explain my thoughts on this.</p><h1>Why shouldn&#x27;t I use stdClass?</h1><h2>Readability</h2><p>One of the first things I learned about throwing exceptions is that they should be meaningful. It&#x27;s trivial to define a named exception and use that to specify the type of exception, and you can then capture exceptions to handle them differently elsewhere in the application. For instance, a validation error is entirely due to a user submitting the wrong details, and should therefore be handled in an entirely different manner to the database going down.</p><p>The same is applicable to an object. If an API client returns an instance of <code>stdClass</code>, that doesn&#x27;t tell me anything about what that object is. If I need to pass it elsewhere in a large application, it may become very difficult to understand what it represents without tracking it back to where it came from, which will slow me down. If instead I use a named class, the name can convey what it represents. It may seem like overkill to create a class that adds no new functionality, but the mere fact that it has a name makes your code more meaningful and easier to understand. I can also add DocBlock comments to describe it further.</p><p>Of course, just giving something a generic name like <code>Container</code> isn&#x27;t much of an improvement, and coming up with meaningful names for classes and methods is notoriously hard. As always, give some serious thoughts into what your objects represent and attempt to give them names that will make it easy to understand what they are if you look at the code base again six months down the line.</p><h2>Type hinting</h2><p>A related argument is that it makes type hinting more useful. You <em>can</em> type hint <code>stdClass</code>, but as noted above it tells someone working on the code receiving it very little about where it&#x27;s come from, or what it represents, and it doesn&#x27;t offer much value since an <code>stdClass</code> could mean anything, and could be created anywhere in the application.</p><p>By contrast, named classes provides much more information about what the type hinted parameter represents. For instance, naming your class something such as <code>App\Api\Response\Item</code>, makes it much clearer that that object represents an individual item returned from an API, and others developers working on the same code base (including your future self, who may not necessarily remember all of the details of how you&#x27;re implementing it now), will have less trouble understanding what is going on. There&#x27;s also a much-reduced likelihood of the same class being used to represent completely different types of data.</p><h2>New functionality</h2><p>Finally, are you sure you don&#x27;t want to add any functionality? PHP includes a number of interfaces that can be <em>extremely</em> useful for working with this sort of data.</p><p>First off, the <code>ArrayAccess</code> interface allows you to access an object&#x27;s values using array syntax, which can be useful. Also, implementing either <code>Iterator</code> or <code>IteratorAggregate</code> will allow you to iterate over the object using a <code>foreach</code> loop. The <code>Countable</code> interface is less useful, since all it does is let you get the number of items, but it&#x27;s sometimes handy. Finally, the <code>Serializable</code> interface lets you serialise an object so it can be stored in a suitable medium, which can sometimes be useful.</p><p>The same also applies to some of the magic methods. The <code>__toString()</code> method, in particular, can be useful for returning a suitable string-based representation of an object - for instance, if it represents an item in a database, it might be appropriate to use this to return the ID of the item, or a text representation of it (eg title for a blog post, or product name for a product in an e-commerce site). The <code>__get()</code> and <code>__set()</code> magic methods may be a bit more dubious, but they can be useful if your object is intended to just be a dumb container as they allow you to make the properties on the object private, but keep them accessible without writing explicit getters and setters. I&#x27;d also suggest adding <code>__debugInfo()</code> to objects unless you have a good reason not to, as when you&#x27;re debugging it can be hard to see the wood for the trees, and returning only the most pertinent data can make your job a <em>lot</em> easier.</p><p>Of course, you don&#x27;t have to implement all this functionality from scratch for every class. It often makes sense to create an abstract class that implements this sort of basic container functionality, and then base all your container classes on that, overriding it when necessary.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, this has made it clear how compelling it is to use named classes instead of <code>stdClass</code>, and how much benefit you can get from not just using named classes, but creating your own base container class for them. I&#x27;m of the opinion that PHP should probably make <code>stdClass</code> abstract to prevent them from being used like this, and indeed I&#x27;m seriously considering the idea of creating a Codesniffer sniff to detect instances of <code>stdClass</code> being instantiated and raise them as an error.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#x27;s a particularly unpleasant type of programmer that exists, and you&#x27;ve probably met him, either online or in person. I call him <strong>PHPStorm Man</strong>.</p><p>NB: Despite the name I&#x27;ve chosen, I&#x27;m not singling out users of PHPStorm in particular about this. The first time I encountered PHPStorm Man in person, he was using Sublime Text, and you will find PHPStorm Men using all different editors and IDEs. PHPStorm Man is an archetype defined not by any particular piece of software, but by a common bad attitude, and given that I work primarily with PHP these days, I&#x27;ve most often encountered this kind of behaviour from PHPStorm users (or at least, people claiming to be PHPStorm users, since at least online you can&#x27;t discount the possibility that they&#x27;re trolls). Users of other languages may well see this behaviour most prominently from those who use some other editor or IDE, but the same underlying phenomenon is at work, whether we call him PHPStorm Man, Eclipse Man, Vim Man or PyCharm Man.</p><h2>Who is PHPStorm Man?</h2><p><span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:500px">

    </span></p><p>PHPStorm Man (and he <em>will</em> almost certainly be a man - while it could be just because our industry is male-dominated, I&#x27;ve <em>never</em> known a woman to behave like this, and I strongly suspect it&#x27;s nothing more than an industry-specific example of the common phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining">mansplaining</a>) doesn&#x27;t know squat about your editor or IDE. He just knows his is superior, and he wants you to know it, regardless of the evidence.</p><p>His knowledge of your editor is probably either non-existent, grossly outdated, plain ill-informed or second-hand (probably from another PHPStorm Man). If he&#x27;s advocating an IDE, he&#x27;ll likely equate all text editors with Notepad - he may claim the advantages of his one over yours include such fundamentals as syntax highlighting and autocompletion.</p><p>He&#x27;ll boast about some feature his editor has that yours doesn&#x27;t, even if it does. If your editor lacks that functionality out of the box, but can add it via a plugin, apparently that doesn&#x27;t count because although you&#x27;re intelligent enough to build a working web app, somehow installing and configuring that plugin is an insurmountable burden (yet mysteriously turning off all the stuff you don&#x27;t need in <em>his</em> editor is quick and easy). If it does do that out of the box, he&#x27;ll probably find some bullshit reason why his editor&#x27;s implementation is better, even if it&#x27;s something as pointless and irrelevant as &quot;it&#x27;s been around longer&quot;. He&#x27;ll likely claim, with absolutely no evidence whatsoever, or indeed in the presence of evidence to the contrary, that you&#x27;d be more productive if you only used his editor.</p><p>In short, if you aren&#x27;t using his editor or IDE of choice, you&#x27;re a troglodyte living in a dung hut.</p><h2>PHPStorm man in the wild</h2><p>I had an encounter with PHPStorm Man in person a while back. Just over two years ago I started a new job, which as it turned out didn&#x27;t last long after I caught the flu that was going around in late 2017 my first week. On the second day, shortly after going over something with me, the senior dev sent me the following message on Slack:</p><blockquote><p>I noticed you&#x27;re using Vim. Have you tried using Sublime Text?</p></blockquote><p>I responded that I had, and chose not to use it. There followed a long string of messages along the following lines:</p><blockquote><p>Him: Sublime Text has X!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: I have that</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: Well Sublime Text also has Y!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: I have that too, via a plugin</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: Well, Sublime Text doesn&#x27;t need a plugin for that</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: Irrelevant since the plugin is already installed and configured, and I know how to use it</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: Well, what about this?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: That sounds cool, so I just found a plugin to do that and installed it</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: And this?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: I have absolutely no need for that</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: Well, Vim is old, Sublime Text is new!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: Actually, this is Neovim, which is technically newer than Sublime Text</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: Well, Sublime Text is a GUI application</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Me: Exactly. That makes it slower and forces me to use the mouse, aggravating my RSI. I use the terminal because it&#x27;s more efficient</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Him: Well, I don&#x27;t mind what you use...(despite the evidence of that entire conversation)</p></blockquote><p>With the benefit of hindsight, what I <em>should</em> have responded with was this:</p><blockquote><p>I&#x27;m an experienced, professional web developer of over six years, and I chose my editor based on years of personal experience, and have chosen my plugins and configuration based on what&#x27;s useful to me, and continue to do so to this day. I don&#x27;t appreciate you talking down to me like a child.</p></blockquote><h2>Why I personally don&#x27;t use an IDE</h2><p>In my case, I have a particularly good reason not to use <em>any</em> GUI application to develop in. Before I was a developer, I worked for an insurance company in a customer service role, and I didn&#x27;t have access to the sort of decent quality keyboards and mice developers habitually use, as well as having output goals linked to discipline and bonus/salary raises and having to use custom internal applications on Windows XP, with dreadful keyboard support. As a result I developed a degree of RSI in both hands, which I&#x27;ve found is aggravated by using any application that requires me to use a mouse extensively - I&#x27;m generally OK if I only have to type, but reaching for the mouse all the time quickly becomes tiring, and soon after painful.</p><p>For that reason I&#x27;ve developed a workflow that&#x27;s strongly dependent on the command line - I use Neovim in the terminal, alongside Byobu so that I can run multiple tabs and switch between them quickly without touching the mouse. Moving to a more GUI-oriented workflow would require me to use the mouse more than I do now, which would probably become physically painful quite quickly. Using an editor or IDE which I found made me more prone to further flare-ups of RSI could have serious consequences for my long-term health, and could potentially be career-ending. If I worked somewhere that mandated a particular IDE that didn&#x27;t work well for me, I&#x27;d <em>have</em> to either negotiate an exception on health and safety grounds or quit.</p><p>I&#x27;m also of the personal opinion that much of the functionality of an IDE should not be, in principle, tied to that IDE, but should instead be the province of more general purpose tools that can used, not merely in any editor or IDE but, where appropriate, on a continuous integration server. For instance, language servers provide a tool-agnostic way for any IDE or editor to implement functionality such as completion or navigation, and linters such as ESLint can integrate into any half-decent editor or run in a CI environment. Since these tend to be open source projects, whereas IDE&#x27;s are normally commercial offerings, they&#x27;re less vulnerable to suddenly disappearing and leaving users high and dry.</p><p>There&#x27;s also a lot of functionality in an IDE that I rarely, if ever, use. There&#x27;s no point including and starting up an FTP client as part of my editor if I&#x27;m never going to use it, as it slows the application down, and nor should I have to root around trying to turn off functionality I&#x27;m never going to have to use. For a lot of other functionality, there are more powerful standalone applications that I&#x27;m used to such as Postman or MySQL Workbench, and I&#x27;ll use them as and when I need them - I gain nothing by having them integrated with my editor.</p><p>I also like to be able to use the same editor everywhere. I still occasionally dabble in Python, so a language-specific IDE wouldn&#x27;t be suitable when switching between languages. I also sometimes work on personal projects on an HP Stream netbook running Xubuntu, which is fine for small PHP projects that don&#x27;t require a database server or any web server other than the PHP dev server. I can happily run Neovim on that, but there&#x27;s no way it could run an IDE at an acceptable speed.</p><p>Last of all, screen real estate is an issue. I don&#x27;t like interfaces that are too busy - I <em>cannot stand</em> having anything, <em>at all</em> on my desktop for any length of time at all, and any interface that has too much on screen at once is distracting. I will typically have Neovim open in a terminal, with the NERDTree file finder open on the left, and two panels split in the main body, and that&#x27;s all. A big factor in my productivity is how much code I can see at once, and having too much screen real estate taken up by menus and sidebars is counterproductive - with Neovim there&#x27;s almost nothing getting in the way.</p><p>I personally have had to give this sort of explanation many, many times as to why I use first Vim and then Neovim, and indeed part of the motivation behind writing this post is that I&#x27;m sick to death of having to explain myself over and over again and will now be able to merely direct them to this article. Thanks to tools like PHPActor, vim-ale and FZF, I don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m missing out on that an IDE would give me, and Psalm is very good at catching type errors without being tied to any one IDE, but that doesn&#x27;t stop people telling me I&#x27;m missing out on features I already have. Any time I come across a feature I think is cool, I go through the following process:</p><ul><li>Find cool feature</li><li>Find plugin that implements said feature</li><li>Install plugin by adding a single line to my Neovim config and running <code>:PlugUpdate</code></li><li>Add a few lines of config</li><li>Start using feature</li></ul><p>Using an IDE <em>would</em> eliminate the middle three steps, but I don&#x27;t find those onerous - we&#x27;re talking about the work of five minutes, which is insignificant compared to the time taken to learn to use the feature effectively. And a feature you don&#x27;t use is one that you still have to start up if it&#x27;s present, so making it an opt-in plugin is often a better way to go.</p><p>Every other developer will have their own version of this story. Some will have stayed mostly static in their editor choices, while others will be changing all the time - indeed, I&#x27;ve sometimes used other editors for specific tasks in the past. In short, everyone has their own reasons for using their editor of choice, and it&#x27;s <em>appallingly</em> arrogant to assume that their reasons for using a particular one are less valid than yours.</p><h2>Am I PHPStorm Man?</h2><p>As I&#x27;ve said before, this behaviour is not confined to PHPStorm users, nor is it in any way universal among them. If you use PHPStorm and enjoy it, then fine, rock on. If you use a different editor or IDE, then that&#x27;s fine too - I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, and nor should your colleagues or line manager. Using any one editor or IDE <em>does not</em> make you PHPStorm Man. What makes you PHPStorm Man is the patronising attitude.</p><p>In the example given above, what made the senior dev PHPStorm Man was not the initial enquiry as to whether I&#x27;d tried Sublime Text, but the fact that he wouldn&#x27;t leave it be when confronted with evidence that I either had, could easily obtain, or didn&#x27;t need the functionality of his editor in mine, and that he was talking down to an experienced developer like a child.</p><p>Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a new development - editor wars have long been a feature of our industry, as has the divide between IDE and editor users. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I, and no doubt others, don&#x27;t get utterly sick of it.</p><h2>How not to be PHPStorm Man</h2><p>When talking to users of other editors or IDE&#x27;s about the subject of those tools, you should always bear this in mind:</p><ul><li>If they use a different tool to you, they probably know a hell of a lot more about it than you do, and are unlikely to take kindly to you ignorantly telling them what it can and can&#x27;t do</li><li>Mastering an editor or IDE can take years, and if they&#x27;re already invested in one, it&#x27;s incredibly arrogant to just assume that they&#x27;re less productive in it than they would be in yours - even if they would (and that&#x27;s almost certainly debatable), it would take some time to adjust.</li><li>They&#x27;ve probably had this conversation many times before, and are sick of hearing it, especially if they have a few years experience under their belt</li><li>Not every feature you use is useful to them</li><li>No-one minds seeing a cool feature, so feel free to demonstrate it, but bear in mind that it&#x27;s almost certainly not limited to that platform - if it&#x27;s sufficiently cool, someone <em>will</em> have made it available as a plugin on most of the major editors and IDE&#x27;s. If they like it, the most likely scenario is that they&#x27;ll look to add that feature to their own editor via a plugin</li><li>Just because it makes you more productive, doesn&#x27;t mean that it would make them more productive</li><li>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to enforce consistent code styles and catch errors using standalone tools such as PHP CodeSniffer, Psalm, or ESLint, and these tools can be integrated in <em>any</em> editor, triggered with Git hooks, or run with continuous integration.</li></ul><p>Now, it has to be said that sometimes there <em>are</em> some people who plod on with painfully outdated tools, like Notepad. But those tools tend to be limited to either commercial offerings that are no longer maintained or supported, or ones that lack any sort of plugin or extension system, making them limited in terms of how they can integrate with other services, so they&#x27;re fairly easy to spot. However, making a particular editor or IDE compulsory is going to be disruptive. If you&#x27;re in a leadership position, one way to resolve this is to simply require that everyone&#x27;s editor have certain functionality - for instance, if you specify that everyone&#x27;s editor must allow integration with PHP CodeSniffer and support for <code>.editorconfig</code>, then anyone using a legacy editor that can&#x27;t support those will need to move away from it, but they&#x27;ll be able to pick one that suits them, rather than be forced into one they may well dislike. Editors and IDE&#x27;s don&#x27;t produce proprietary formats the way word processors do - they work with common formats, and if prominent open-source projects can enforce a consistent coding standard with many different editors there&#x27;s absolutely no reason why your colleagues can&#x27;t do so too.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>This post is a bit of an angry rant, but at the same time it shouldn&#x27;t be taken <em>too</em> seriously. As I said, despite the name <em>PHPStorm Man</em>, it&#x27;s not specifically about users of any one editor or IDE, but about the widespread, patronising attitude many developers have about editors and IDE&#x27;s other than their own in general.</p><p>Someone using a different IDE or editor is absolutely none of your business unless you&#x27;re their line manager or you work on the same code base, and even then it should only be an issue if it causes a clear effect on their productivity or the quality of their code. If that&#x27;s not the case, keep your nose out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2019 21:20:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many developers who use React.js, I&#x27;ve been eager to explore the Hooks API in the last year or so. They allow for easier ways to share functionality between components, and can allow for a more expressive syntax that&#x27;s a better fit for Javascript than class-based components. Unfortunately, they became production ready around the time I rolled out a new React-based home page, so I didn&#x27;t want to jump on them immediately in the context of a legacy application. I&#x27;m now finding myself with a bit of breathing space, so I&#x27;ve begun refactoring these components, and converting some to use hooks, in order to more easily reuse some code that currently resides in a big higher-order component.</p><p>The <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks are by far the most common hooks in most applications. However, I&#x27;ve found that the React documentation, while OK at explaining how to use these individually, is not so good at explaining how to use them together, particularly in the case of an input component, which is a common use case when looking to convert existing components. For that reason, I&#x27;m going to provide a short example of how you might use them together for that use case.</p><h2>A simple function component</h2><p>A basic component for an input might look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">//@flow
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

type Props = {
  name: string,
  id: string,
  value: string,
  placeholder: string
};

const Input = (props: Props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name={props.name} id={props.id} value={props.value} placeholder={props.placeholder} /&gt;
  );
}

export default Input;
</code></pre><p>Note I&#x27;m using Flow annotations to type the arguments passed to my components. If you prefer Typescript it should be straightforward to convert to that.</p><p>As you can see, this component accepts a name, ID, value and placeholder as props. If you add this to an existing React app, or use <code>create-react-app</code> to create one and add this to it, you can include it in another component as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Input name=&quot;foo&quot; id=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;foo&quot; placeholder=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre><h2>Adding state</h2><p>This will render, but as the value will never change it&#x27;s not actually of any use in a form. If you&#x27;ve written class-based React components before, you&#x27;ll know that the usual way to handle this is to move the value of the input from props to state. Prior to the introduction of the Hooks API, while you could create a function component, you couldn&#x27;t use state with it, making situations like this difficult to handle. Fortunately, the <code>useState</code> hook now allows you to add state to a function component as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">//@flow
import React, { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

type Props = {
  name: string,
  id: string,
  value: string,
  placeholder: string
};

const Input = (props: Props) =&gt; {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(props.value);

  return (
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name={props.name} id={props.id} value={value} placeholder={props.placeholder} onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)} /&gt;
  );
}

export default Input;
</code></pre><p>We import the <code>useState</code> hook at the top, as usual. Then, within the body of the component, we call <code>useState()</code>, passing in the initial value of <code>props.value</code>, and get back two variables in response:</p><ul><li><code>value</code> is the value of the state variable, and can be thought of as equivalent to what <code>this.state.value</code> would be in a class-based component</li><li><code>setValue</code> is a function for updating <code>value</code> - rather than explicitly defining a function for this, we can just get one back from <code>useState()</code></li></ul><p>Now we can set the value with <code>value={value}</code>. We also need to handle changes in the state, so we add <code>onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)}</code> to call <code>setValue()</code> on a change event on the input.</p><h2>Handling effects</h2><p>The component will now allow you to edit the value. However, one problem remains. If you open the React dev tools, go to the props for this component, and set <code>value</code> manually, it won&#x27;t be reflected in the input&#x27;s value, because the state has diverged from the initial value passed in as a prop. We need to be able to pick up on changes in the props and pass them through as state.</p><p>In class-based components, there are lifecycle methods that fire at certain times, such as <code>componentDidMount()</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate()</code>, and we would use those to handle that situation. Hooks condense these into a single <code>useEffect</code> hook that is more widely useful. Here&#x27;s how we might overcome this problem in our component:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">//@flow
import React, { useState, useEffect } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

type Props = {
  name: string,
  id: string,
  value: string,
  placeholder: string
};

const Input = (props: Props) =&gt; {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(props.value);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setValue(props.value);
  }, [props.value]);

  return (
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name={props.name} id={props.id} value={value} placeholder={props.placeholder} onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)}/&gt;
  );
}

export default Input;
</code></pre><p><code>useEffect</code> takes one compulsory argument, in the form of a callback. Here we&#x27;re using that callback to set our state variable back to the value of the prop passed through.</p><p>Note the second argument, which is an array of variables that should be watched for changes. If we had used the following code instead:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setValue(props.value);
  });
</code></pre><p>Then the callback would fire after every render, reverting the value back and possibly causing an infinite loop. For that reason, we pass through the second argument, which tells React to only fire the callback if one of the specified variables has changed. Here we only want to override the state when the value props passed down to the component changes, so we pass that prop in as an argument.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>This is only a simple example, but it does show how simple and expressive hooks can make your React components, and how to use the <code>useEffect</code> and <code>useState</code> hooks together, which was something I found the documentation didn&#x27;t make clear. These two hooks cover a large chunk of the functionality of React, and knowledge of them is essential to using React effectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relational databases have many advantages over other data stores. They&#x27;re (mostly) solid, mature products, they have the means to prevent data duplication while still allowing related data to be accessed, and they allow for easy enforcement of data types. However, the latter point has also historically made them less flexible compared to document databases such as MongoDB, which allow for fields to be set dynamically, making it much easier to set content arbitrarily.</p><p>One area in which this has caused particular problems is with content management systems, where you might want to be able to set custom content types that need to be treated the same in some circumstances, and have some fields in common, but store different data. If you want to be able to store arbitrary data against a particular entity, historically the main way to do that is to create a meta table to contain keys and values, and set the entity ID as a foreign key in the new table.</p><p>Wordpress is a common example of this. Any piece of content is stored in the <code>wp_posts</code> table, which in addition to the generic structure of a post, also includes the <code>post_type</code> field. It&#x27;s possible to create and register your own post types, but it&#x27;s not possible to store additional custom data in that table. Instead, it&#x27;s stored as keys and values in the <code>wp_postmeta</code> table, meaning you need to do a join to retrieve that content at the same time, making for more complex queries.</p><p>Another approach is to have a generic entity table that contains the common fields, and separate tables for the rest, and then set up a one-to-one relationship between them. However, that can be fiddly too because it doesn&#x27;t allow for custom types in the same way, so it may not fit with your use case if you need to be able to create arbitrary content types, such as for a CMS that allowed for custom content types.</p><h2>Introducing JSON fields</h2><p>JSON fields allow you to bring some of the flexibility of document databases to the relational world. They allow you to store whatever arbitrary text data you wish as JSON, and retrieve it as usual. More importantly, they also allow you to query by that data, so you can easily filter by fields that need not be set in stone with a database schema.</p><p>This means that in the above example of a CMS, instead of having a separate meta table, you can instead store the meta values in a JSON field, thus removing the need for a join and simplifying querying by those values.</p><p>PostgreSQL has had this capability for a long time, but it&#x27;s only comparatively recently that MySQL and MariaDB versions that support it have become widespread. Here I&#x27;ll show you how you might use it in a Laravel application.</p><p>The example will be a content management system with flexible content types. The first step is to create the migration to add the new content table:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateContent extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create(&#x27;content&#x27;, function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table-&gt;bigIncrements(&#x27;id&#x27;);
            $table-&gt;string(&#x27;type&#x27;, 20);
            $table-&gt;json(&#x27;attributes&#x27;);
            $table-&gt;timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists(&#x27;content&#x27;);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Here we&#x27;re specifying the following fields:</p><ul><li>An auto-incrementing ID (feel free to swap this out for a UUID if it makes sense for your application)</li><li>A string denoting the content type. If you want to limit the values these can accept, you can replace it with an <code>ENUM</code> field</li><li>The JSON field, named <code>attributes</code></li><li>The standard Laravel timestamp fields, <code>created_at</code> and <code>updated_at</code></li></ul><p>If there are certain fields that are common to all of your content types, it would also make sense to define them as fields in the usual way, rather than use the JSON field, since compulsory fields should be enforced by the database.</p><p>Next, we&#x27;ll create the model:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Content extends Model
{
    protected $table = &#x27;content&#x27;;

    protected $casts = [
        &#x27;attributes&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;array&#x27;
    ];
}
</code></pre><p>Note that we cast the <code>attributes</code> field to an array. If we didn&#x27;t do this, we&#x27;d need to manually run <code>json_encode()</code> and <code>json_decode()</code> on the field to get it back in a usable form. As it is, we can now easily retrieve fields using array access.</p><p>With that done, we can now set up some data:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
$c = new App\Content;
$c-&gt;type = &#x27;page&#x27;;
$c-&gt;attributes = [ 
    &quot;type&quot; =&gt; &quot;info&quot;,
    &quot;title&quot; =&gt; &quot;Terms&quot;,
    &quot;content&quot; =&gt; &quot;Our Terms&quot;,
    &quot;layout&quot; =&gt; &quot;info&quot;,
];
$c-&gt;save();
$c = new App\Content;
$c-&gt;type = &#x27;link&#x27;;
$c-&gt;attributes = [ 
    &quot;type&quot; =&gt; &quot;external&quot;,
    &quot;link&quot; =&gt; &quot;http://example.com&quot;,
];
$c-&gt;save();
$c = new App\Content;
$c-&gt;type = &#x27;page&#x27;;
$c-&gt;attributes = [ 
    &quot;type&quot; =&gt; &quot;promotional&quot;,
    &quot;title&quot; =&gt; &quot;My page&quot;,
    &quot;content&quot; =&gt; &quot;This is my page&quot;,
    &quot;layout&quot; =&gt; &quot;default&quot;,
];
$c-&gt;save();
</code></pre><p>As you can see, we&#x27;ve been able to set out whatever arbitrary fields we wish on these items. We can then call <code>toArray()</code> on a model to get all the fields, including the attributes, or we can call <code>$c-&gt;attributes</code> to get all those attributes together. We can also get a field via array access, eg <code>$c-&gt;attributes[&#x27;type&#x27;]</code>.</p><h2>Querying the data</h2><p>The syntax for querying JSON fields is a little bit fiddly:</p><pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM `content` WHERE attributes -&gt; &#x27;$.type&#x27; = &#x27;promotional&#x27;;
</code></pre><p>Fortunately, Eloquent makes it much simpler:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
Content::where(&#x27;attributes-&gt;type&#x27;, &#x27;promotional&#x27;)-&gt;get();
</code></pre><p>It&#x27;s also possible to order by a JSON field value, but at the time of writing there&#x27;s no neat syntax for it, so you have to drop down to writing it using <code>orderByRaw</code> in Eloquent:</p><pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
Content::orderByRaw(&quot;attributes-&gt; &#x27;$.type&#x27;&quot;)-&gt;get();
</code></pre><p>Eloquent also supports a few other JSON query types, such as querying if an array contains a value, and I suggest <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/queries#json-where-clauses">referring to the documentation</a> if you want to know more.</p><h2>Other applications</h2><p>There are many other scenarios where this approach can be useful. For instance, e-commerce sites often sell many different products that may have arbitrary properties, and it may be necessary to sort and filter by different properties for different types of products. A store that sells, among other things, shoes and storage containers, might need a colour and capacity field for storage containers, and a colour and size field for shoes. Using this approach, you can set up your database in such a way that those arbitrary fields can be set up when needed, and used for filtering.</p><p>This approach is not without its downsides. Any data that&#x27;s stored in a JSON field can&#x27;t be validated by the database in the same way, so the burden of ensuring that it remains in a consistent state is moved to your application code. However, it&#x27;s no worse than it would be if you used a document database, and unlike with a document database you can combine JSON and more traditional fields as you see fit.</p>]]></content:encoded>
