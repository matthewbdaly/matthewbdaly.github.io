However, when you start doing something like this it's easy to miss a few files that haven't been updated, or forget to do it, so I wanted a way to detect PHP classes that are not set as either abstract or final, and if possible, set them as final automatically. I've mentioned before that I use PHP CodeSniffer extensively, and that has the capability to both find and resolve deviations from a coding style, so last night I started looking into the possibility of creating a coding standard for this.
