In this post, I'll explain some of the consequences when your code base is bad.

Developers are not superhuman, and we can only hold so much in our heads at one time, which is why many of the principles behind a clean and maintainable code base can essentially be boiled down to \\\"break it into bite-sized chunks so developers can understand each one in isolation before seeing how they fit together\\\".\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If one particular class or function gets too big and starts doing too much, it quickly becomes very, very hard to get your head around what that code does. Developers typically have to build a mental model of how a class or function works before they can use it effectively, and the smaller and simpler you can keep each unit of code, the less time and effort it takes to do so. The mark of a skilled developer is not the complexity of their code bases, but their simplicity - they've learned to make their code as small, simple, and readable as possible. A clean and well laid-out code base makes it easy for developers to get into the mental state called \\\"flow\\\" that is significantly more productive.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In addition, if an application doesn't conform to accepted conventions in some way, such as using inappropriate HTTP verbs (eg \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"GET\"), \" to change the state of something), then quite apart from the fact that it won't play well with proxy servers, it imposes an additional mental load on developers by forcing them to drop a reasonable set of assumptions about how the application works.
