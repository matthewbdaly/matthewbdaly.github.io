It includes an AJAX search that uses Fuse.js on the front end, the index for which is generated by a console task built on top of the Symfony Console component. Recently I noticed that although the unit tests still passed, the console task to generate the index no longer worked as expected due to an issue with Flysystem.

A more likely scenario in many cases is that if you want to automate catching the error, you'll need to create an automated test to reproduce that error, and run that test with \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"git bisect run\"), \". Given that TDD already recommends writing a test to reproduce a bug before fixing it, it's prudent to write the test first, then use it to run the bisect command, before fixing the bug and committing both the fix and the new test, so as to not only minimise the manual work required, but also ensure it won't crop up again.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Certain classes of issues are more difficult to automate in this way - for example, visual regressions in CSS. If you're using a library like React or Vue, snapshot testing may be a good way to automate the bisect process for HTML rendered by components, or you could try the approach I've mentioned before for snapshot testing PHP applications. For legacy applications that can't create and tear down a database for testing purposes due to gaps in the migration history, it can also be tricky and time-consuming to ensure consistency between runs. However, if you can do it, automating the bisect command makes it much quicker, and leaves you with a test you can retain to ensure that bug never returns again.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"The  bisect  command in Git can be very useful when trying to catch any regressions.
