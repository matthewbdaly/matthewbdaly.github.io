This CMS uses the Stash caching library, and I wanted it to actively support all of the cache backends Stash provides. The CMS is configured using YAML, and I'd written a factory class that takes in the cache configuration and returns an adapter. The problem was that there are three adapters that require additional software to be installed, namely the APC, Redis and Memcached adapters. Installing all the packages to use all three of the adapters is onerous, and while it's a good idea to test them all, it's generally not worth the bother of adding all of them to your local development environment where you need your tests to run as fast as possible.

Tests that are slower or require multiple services to be installed can still be run by your continuous integration server, which can afford to be slower since it's not a blocker in the same way. In addition, I'm only ever really interested in coverage stats on the CI server, since enabling that slows PHPUnit down a lot, so since coverage is a non-issue locally we can happily leave covering that dependency to our CI server. In this case, the project is hosted on Github and uses Travis CI for running the tests and Coveralls for recording coverage, so we can leave the full test suite to be run on Travis CI, ensuring full coverage, while skipping those tests that require Redis, Memcached or APC locally.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Having a comprehensive test suite, and running it regularly during development, is important, but that doesn't mean it's compulsory you run every test regularly.
