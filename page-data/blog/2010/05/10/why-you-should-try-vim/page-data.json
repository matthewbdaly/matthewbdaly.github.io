Notepad, then I want to get you to think hard about switching to Vim!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I first started using Vim nearly two years ago. At the time, I had a fair grasp of HTML, but hadn't really gotten into programming as such. I had my Eee PC 2G Surf with me most of the time, but didn't have regular access to the Internet, and didn't have a full-sized laptop available for much of the time.

As a touch-typist, Vim worked really well for me since it meant I didn't have to move my hands off the keyboard at all, and the arcane-sounding keys soon became second nature. When I started work on the Site Development Foundations part of my CIW Foundation course, naturally I used Vim, and it worked well for both HTML and CSS documents, and of course the more I used it the more proficient at it I became.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then when I first started learning Python, Vim really came into its own. The syntax highlighting is a real help, it's extremely fast to move around in and edit a document, and the auto-completion, while perhaps not quite as good as that in a language-specific IDE, was good enough for most purposes. I've since used Vim for coding in HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and C, as well as editing configuration files in various Unix-like operating systems, and it's been an excellent editor for all of these. I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do, and I already couldn't imagine using anything else.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, why should you use Vim?

If you're running another Unix flavour, again you almost certainly have Vim or another vi clone, and if not you can get one. And if you're on Windows you can grab a copy too. If you use a text editor like Kate, gedit, or so on, then you can't guarantee you can get it on other platforms.

The key bindings are deceptively simple to remember for the most part, as it's your fingers that need to remember them, not you brain.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Vim doesn't require the use of a mouse to navigate, nor does it require you to move your hand to the cursor keys. It also allows you to jump through a document as many times as you want - for instance, to go down 9 lines, you just enter \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"9j\"), \".

For instance, recently I was writing a JavaScript function to rate passwords for security, and I decided to get a list of bad passwords off the Web. I soon found one, but it was in excess of three thousand entries long, and I had to edit it to put them all into an array as individual strings, enclosed by quotes and separated by commas, ideally each on a line by themselves. This would have been an incredibly tedious task if I had to do it manually, so I did a little digging and discovered how to create a macro in Vim.

Yes, the learning curve can be a bit steep, but it's well worth it in terms of boosting your productivity. It works well for hand-coding HTML and CSS, or for programming in almost any language you can think of. You can get started today - if you're using Linux or Mac OS X, it's almost certainly already there waiting for you, and on Windows it's just a download away. Try launching the tutorial by entering \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"vimtutor\"), \" in the shell, and work through it, and you'll find yourself getting used to it surprisingly quickly.
