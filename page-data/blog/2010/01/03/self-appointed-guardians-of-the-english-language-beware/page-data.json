Usually scared by endless Daily Mail articles (along the lines of \\\"Children using text speak in schoolwork/exams!

The English language predates dictionaries by many centuries, although naturally it has mutated over its lifetime.

Until dictionaries became popular, words generally had no fixed spelling.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A dictionary is not a definition of the English language, as some people seem to think. It's actually a record of the English language as generally spoken at a specific point in time.  The Oxford English Dictionary styles itself as \\\"The definitive record of the English language\\\".

It's going in!\\\"), but by passing into common usage. Once a word is commonplace enough it may be included in the dictionary, but the dictionaries are not the arbiters of what the English language is by choosing what words to include, any more than newspapers are the arbiters of what is going on in the world by choosing whether or not to report it. If a dictionary does not include a number of words that many people use, it does not mean those people are in any way mistreating the English language, it means that by not having a record of those words the dictionary does not paint an accurate picture of the language in its present state and is thus deficient.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Furthermore, many technical terms will never be used by the great majority of people and thus will never gain sufficient currency to be worthy of consideration for inclusion in a dictionary.

With so many different speakers with different dialects constantly influencing each other, and a fast-moving world where new terms are being coined all the time, and others being imported from other languages, then in practical terms it's unreasonable to expect the language to remain static.
