It's a simple brochure-style website advertising a friend's chalet at a seaside resort, which she wants to be able to rent out, and includes a simple contact form so that people can get in touch to ask questions or make a booking enquiry. Now, at present Python is the only programming language I know at all well that's useful for server-side scripting, but I decided to have a bash at building it using PHP, since that's pretty well supported and there's loads of tutorials and resources for teaching PHP to newbies, as well as innumerable third-party scripts and libraries. Also, PHP's such a popular language that you can't really get away from it if you want to get into web development - I see loads of PHP jobs advertised but very few Python ones. So I figured it'll be useful to have picked up a little PHP.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I got the form working, and I've added reCAPTCHA support to it to help prevent spam. All in all the form is working well, and it didn't take a great deal of PHP knowledge to write the script. I'm already pretty confident that it's a language I can work with in future, possibly even on a professional basis. That said, I can already tell that I will never like working with PHP as much as I like working with Python - the syntax is far less elegant than that of Python, and the object-orientation looks and feels much more clumsy to me.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's plenty of things I'd like to be able to do that require PHP, so I will be learning it thoroughly at some point, although I have no plans to do so immediately - I'm about to do my JavaScript Fundamentals exam later this month, and after that I've got to learn Perl, so it's not till I get that done that I'll be learning PHP properly. In particular, I'm really interested in Wordpress theme development - I want to build a theme of my own for this blog since that'll say more about my abilities than an off-the-shelf theme, and it also happens to be an increasingly marketable skill.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"I'm currently working on my very first website for anyone other than myself.
