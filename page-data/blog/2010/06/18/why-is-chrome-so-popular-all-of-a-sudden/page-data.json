Chrome is still behind Firefox, which takes up a huge 46.9% of the hits, but it's not bad for a browser that's been out for less than two years. More notably, Chrome has increased its market share by around 5% in the last six months, while IE6 has declined by a little over 3%.

Accepted wisdom for some time has been that non-technical users just use whatever browser comes with their computer, thus giving IE a huge advantage, but the increasing popularity of Chrome runs counter to this, so it's clearly more complex than that.
