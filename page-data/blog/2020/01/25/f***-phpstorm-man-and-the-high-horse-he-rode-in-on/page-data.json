Before I was a developer, I worked for an insurance company in a customer service role, and I didn't have access to the sort of decent quality keyboards and mice developers habitually use, as well as having output goals linked to discipline and bonus/salary raises and having to use custom internal applications on Windows XP, with dreadful keyboard support. As a result I developed a degree of RSI in both hands, which I've found is aggravated by using any application that requires me to use a mouse extensively - I'm generally OK if I only have to type, but reaching for the mouse all the time quickly becomes tiring, and soon after painful.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For that reason I've developed a workflow that's strongly dependent on the command line - I use Neovim in the terminal, alongside Byobu so that I can run multiple tabs and switch between them quickly without touching the mouse. Moving to a more GUI-oriented workflow would require me to use the mouse more than I do now, which would probably become physically painful quite quickly.

For instance, language servers provide a tool-agnostic way for any IDE or editor to implement functionality such as completion or navigation, and linters such as ESLint can integrate into any half-decent editor or run in a CI environment. Since these tend to be open source projects, whereas IDE's are normally commercial offerings, they're less vulnerable to suddenly disappearing and leaving users high and dry.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's also a lot of functionality in an IDE that I rarely, if ever, use. There's no point including and starting up an FTP client as part of my editor if I'm never going to use it, as it slows the application down, and nor should I have to root around trying to turn off functionality I'm never going to have to use. For a lot of other functionality, there are more powerful standalone applications that I'm used to such as Postman or MySQL Workbench, and I'll use them as and when I need them - I gain nothing by having them integrated with my editor.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I also like to be able to use the same editor everywhere. I still occasionally dabble in Python, so a language-specific IDE wouldn't be suitable when switching between languages. I also sometimes work on personal projects on an HP Stream netbook running Xubuntu, which is fine for small PHP projects that don't require a database server or any web server other than the PHP dev server. I can happily run Neovim on that, but there's no way it could run an IDE at an acceptable speed.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Last of all, screen real estate is an issue. I don't like interfaces that are too busy - I \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"cannot stand\"), \" having anything, \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"at all\"), \" on my desktop for any length of time at all, and any interface that has too much on screen at once is distracting. I will typically have Neovim open in a terminal, with the NERDTree file finder open on the left, and two panels split in the main body, and that's all. A big factor in my productivity is how much code I can see at once, and having too much screen real estate taken up by menus and sidebars is counterproductive - with Neovim there's almost nothing getting in the way.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I personally have had to give this sort of explanation many, many times as to why I use first Vim and then Neovim, and indeed part of the motivation behind writing this post is that I'm sick to death of having to explain myself over and over again and will now be able to merely direct them to this article. Thanks to tools like PHPActor, vim-ale and FZF, I don't feel like there's anything I'm missing out on that an IDE would give me, and Psalm is very good at catching type errors without being tied to any one IDE, but that doesn't stop people telling me I'm missing out on features I already have.

However, making a particular editor or IDE compulsory is going to be disruptive. If you're in a leadership position, one way to resolve this is to simply require that everyone's editor have certain functionality - for instance, if you specify that everyone's editor must allow integration with PHP CodeSniffer and support for \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \".editorconfig\"), \", then anyone using a legacy editor that can't support those will need to move away from it, but they'll be able to pick one that suits them, rather than be forced into one they may well dislike.
