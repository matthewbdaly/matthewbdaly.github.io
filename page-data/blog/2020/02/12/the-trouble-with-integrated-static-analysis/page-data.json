The development role in which I spent the most time was one in which I had no peer feedback or mentoring at all, and while I could definitely have done with more peer review than I had, automated tools helped fill the gap a little bit.

Not all developers have had the sort of experience that leads one to really appreciate the value of coding standards and type hints, particularly if they've worked primarily on small or greenfield projects, or in environments where the emphasis was on churning out large quantities of work, and getting developers to tidy up the sort of issues these tools identify can sometimes be a tough sell when faced with code which, at least superficially, works.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Suppose you take on a new developer and ask them to work alone on a particular project for several months. Due to your own workload you can't easily schedule code reviews with them, so you don't see what they're writing until they're done. Then you take a look at what they've written and it's full of issues that the IDE caught, but the developer either didn't bother to fix, or didn't know how to. What they've done may well work, but they've introduced a huge morass of technical debt that will slow down future development for the foreseeable future.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If your static analysis tools work only in the context of a given editor or IDE, then if the new dev introduce issues in the code base and doesn't resolve them because they don't know how, or don't see the value, then the first you knows about it is when you clone the repo yourself and open it up. With a solution that runs in a CI environment, you can catch any reduction in code quality when it's pushed. Sure, code reviews can do that too, but that requires manual input in a way that not every team is willing to spare, whereas a CI server, once set up, is largely self sustaining. And you could run one tool locally and another in a CI environment, but you can't be sure they'll necessarily catch all the same issues.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now consider the same scenario if you're using a separate code quality tool that's integrated both into the editor, and your continuous integration workflow. Obviously, it will depend on your personal CI setup, but once code quality either begins to drop, or drops below a given level, the CI server will mark the build as failed, and you'll be alerted. You can therefore then raise the issue with the new dev before it gets out of hand, and provide whatever support they need to resolve the problem there and then.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I personally maintain a legacy project in which, at one point prior to my arrival, a junior dev introduced an enormous amount of technical debt after working on it alone for six months. An integrated linter or static analysis tool probably wouldn't have stopped that from happening, for the reasons stated above, but if a similar tool were part of the CI workflow, it could have been flagged as an issue much earlier and dealt with. Yes, leaving a junior dev unsupported and unsupervised for that length of time isn't a great idea, but it happens, particularly in busy environments such as agencies. A good CI setup lets you see if someone is adding these kinds of issues, and act to nip it in the bud before it becomes too much of a problem, which is ultimately good for that developer's career.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Peer pressure can also be a strong motivating factor under these circumstances. By simply displaying a metric, you encourage people's natural competitiveness, so displaying code quality stats in your CI dashboard will encourage your team to do better in this regard, and no-one wants to be visibly seen to be letting the team down by producing substandard code.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For these reasons, where possible for feedback on code quality, I would always prefer to rely on a standalone tool that can be integrated with an editor, or used as part of a continuous integration workflow, as opposed to any IDE-specific functionality.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"I've always been a big fan in general of tools that provide feedback about the quality of my code.
