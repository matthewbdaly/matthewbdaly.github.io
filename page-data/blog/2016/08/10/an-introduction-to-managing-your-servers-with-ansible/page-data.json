It's simple to get started with, and if you're willing to put in the time writing your own playbooks then in the long run you'll save yourself a lot of time and grief by making it easy to set up new servers and administer existing ones. Hopefully this has given you a taster of what you can do with Ansible - from here on the documentation is worth a look as it lists all of the modules that ship with Ansible. If there's a particular task you dread, such as setting up a mail server, then Ansible is a very good way to automate that away so it's easier next time.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My experience is that it's best to make an effort to try to standardise on two or three different stacks for different purposes, and create Ansible playbooks for those stacks.

That way I know that any sites I build with Laravel will be using that stack. Knowing my servers are more consistent makes it easier to work with them and identify problems.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"If, like me, you're a web developer who sometimes also has to wear a sysadmin's hat, then you'll probably be coming across the same set of tasks each time you set up a new server…","frontmatter":{"title":"An introduction to managing your servers with Ansible","date":"10th August 2016 7:45 pm","isoDate":"2016-08-10T19:45:56+00:00","categories":["ansible","sysadmin","python"]},"fields":{"path":"/blog/2016/08/10/an-introduction-to-managing-your-servers-with-ansible/"}}},"pageContext":{"previous":{"fields":{"path":"/blog/2016/08/08/testing-your-api-documentation-with-dredd/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Testing your API documentation with Dredd","date":"2016-08-08 17:05:00 +0100","layout":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"path":"/blog/2016/08/15/creating-a-personal-dashboard-with-react-and-webpack/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a personal dashboard with React and Webpack","date":"2016-08-15 23:18:00 +0100","layout":"post"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1776624730","3528622268"]}
