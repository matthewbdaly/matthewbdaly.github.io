Quite frankly, I find that utterly laughable. I make a point of avoiding writing raw SQL when I can use an ORM, and I still often find myself having to write raw SQL, particularly if I'm prototyping a complex query. It does make it unnecessary to write out simple queries in SQL, but I'm not going to benefit in the slightest at this point in my career by writing something like \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"SELECT * FROM posts\"), \" over and over if I can call \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Post::all()\"), \" instead.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Hydration can become a bottleneck for large datasets\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It has to be said, there \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"is\"), \" inevitably some overhead from instantiating an ORM model, which can be quite a complex class, compared to instantiating an array of data, and if you have to work with a response that contains a large number of rows, it may be better to return arrays than model instances.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Case in point, the Zend 1 project I maintain has a number of reports which the client downloads once a week. This includes a report of all the current users in the system, and although users who leave are cleaned out of the system automatically, there's typically around thirty thousand rows returned from this query. That's big enough that the time taken to instantiate a model instance for each row can become significant, and you don't need a model instance if all you're going to do is dump the data out to a CSV file, so the additional overhead of instantiating the ORM models may not be worth it. So in those circumstances, you're better off using the query builder and returning an array - it'll be quicker and use less memory.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Fortunately, it's easy to convert an Eloquent query to a query builder one by calling the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"getQuery()\"), \" method.
