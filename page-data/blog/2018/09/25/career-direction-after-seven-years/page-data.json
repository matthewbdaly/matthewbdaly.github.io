In 2015, I was working at a small agency with a dev team of three, including me, and it became apparent that we needed to standardise on a single framework. I'd been using CodeIgniter on and off for several years, but it was tired and dated, yet I couldn't justify using Django because no-one else was familiar with Python, so we settled on Laravel. Ever since, Laravel has been my go-to framework - Django does some things better (Django REST Framework remains the best way I've ever found to create a REST API), but Laravel does enough stuff well enough that I can use it for most things I need, so it's a good default option.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"I \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"really\"), \" don't want to work with Wordpress often, and if I do, I'd feel a lot better about it if I used Bedrock.
