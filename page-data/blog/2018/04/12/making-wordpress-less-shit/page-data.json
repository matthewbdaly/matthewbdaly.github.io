Instead, this post is about bringing your Wordpress development workflow more into line with how you develop with MVC frameworks like Laravel, so that you have a better experience working with and maintaining Wordpress sites.

Arguably that's at the expense of site owners, since it makes it harder for non-developers to manage the site, however for any Wordpress site that's sufficiently complex to need development work done that's a trade-off worth making. I've been involved in projects where Wordpress got used alongside an MVC framework for some custom functionality, and in my experience it caused a world of problems when updating plugins and themes because version control would get out of sync, so moving that to use Composer to manage them instead would have been a huge win.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Using Bedrock means that if you have a parent theme you use all the time, or custom plugins of your own, you can install them using Composer by adding the Git repositories to your \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"composer.json\"), \", making it easier to re-use functionality you've already developed.

As a result, it should now be possible to build more complex and powerful user interfaces for that data.
