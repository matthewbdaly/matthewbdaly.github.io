The client has several channels that represent different parts of the business that would expect to see different content on the home page, and access to content is limited first by channel, and then by location. The client wanted an additional channel added. Due to bad design earlier in the application's lifetime that isn't yet practical to refactor away, each type of location has its own model, so it was necessary to add a new location model. It also had to work seamlessly, in the same way as the other location types. Unfortunately, these branch types didn't use polymorphism, and instead used large switch statements, and it wasn't practical to refactor all that away in one go. This was therefore quite a high-risk job, especially considering the paucity of tests on a legacy code base.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I'd heard of the concept of a \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"golden master test\"), \" before. If you haven't heard of it before, the idea is that it works by running a process, capturing the output, and then comparing the output of that known good version against future runs. It's very much a test of last resort since, in the context of a web app, it's potentially very brittle since it depends on the state of the application remaining the same between runs to avoid false positives. I needed a set of simple \\\"snapshot tests\\\", similar to how snapshot testing works with Jest, to catch unexpected breakages in a large number of pages, and this approach seemed to fit the bill.

It's also very slow, with each test taking three or four seconds to run, although again this would be less of an issue if I could pass through a request object and get the response HTML directly.
