It's easy for even non-technical stakeholders to understand, it makes it natural to break your tests into easily reusable steps, and it encourages you to think about the application from an end-user's perspective. It's also one of the easiest ways to get started writing automated tests when you first start out - it's much more intuitive to a junior developer than lower-level unit tests, and is easier to add to a legacy project that may not have been built with testability in mind - if you can drive a browser, you can test it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"http://behat.org/en/latest/\"\n  }, \"Behat\"), \" is a PHP equivalent.

I wanted something that I could use to run integration tests using PHPUnit's assertions and Laravel's testing utilities, and crucially, I wanted to do so as quickly as possible. That meant running a web server and using an automated web browser wasn't an option.
