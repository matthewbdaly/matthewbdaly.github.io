While it takes a bit of getting used to if you're used to something like Guzzle, it means that you're giving consumers of your library the freedom to choose the HTTP client of their choice, meaning they don't have to fight with several different libraries requiring different versions of Guzzle. It also allows for easy resolution of the HTTP client, rather than having to explicitly pass through an instance when instantiating your client.
