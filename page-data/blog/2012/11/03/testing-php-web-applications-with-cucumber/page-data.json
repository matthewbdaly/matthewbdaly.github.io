I gave Selenium IDE a try, but I found that to be annoyingly unreliable when recording tests. I'd heard of Cucumber, so I did some googling, found some resources, and began tinkering with that. Quite quickly, I had a few basic acceptance tests up and running that were much more reliable than Selenium IDE, and much less tedious to use than manual testing.
