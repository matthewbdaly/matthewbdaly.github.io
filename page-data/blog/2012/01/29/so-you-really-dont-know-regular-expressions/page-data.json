For instance, say you've obtained the data that you want to pass through into an array from a text file and it's somewhat inconsistent - perhaps the information you want is separated by differing amounts and types of whitespace, or different characters. The explode() function simply won't handle that (at least, not without a lot of pain). But with Perl's split() function, that's no problem.

These use a format of one or two letters, followed by one digit, then may have an additional digit or letter, then a space, then a digit, then two letters.

Well, regular expressions are an extremely powerful part of PHP that are very useful, they're just not as central to the language as they are in Perl.\\xA0PHP actually has two distinct types of regular expressions - POSIX-extended regular expressions, and Perl-compatible regular expressions (or PCRE). However, POSIX-extended regular expressions were deprecated from PHP 5.3 onwards, so it's not really worth taking the time to learn them when PCRE will do exactly the same thing and is going to be around for the future. Furthermore, most other programming languages also support Perl-compatible regular expressions, so they're fairly portable between languages, and once you've learned them in one language, you can easily use them in another. In other words, if you learn how to work with regular expressions in Perl, you can very easily transfer that knowledge to most other programming languages that support regular expressions.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In the first example given above, we can replace explode() with preg_split, and the syntax is virtually identical to split() in Perl, with the only difference being the name of the function and that the pattern to match is wrapped in double quotes:\"), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\",\n    \"className\": \"language-php\"\n  }, \"<?php\\n$fruit = \\\"apple,banana,cherry\\\";\\necho $fruit.\\\"\\\\n\\\";\\n$fruitArray = preg_split(\\\"/,/\\\",$fruit);\\nforeach($fruitArray as $fruitArrayItem)\\n{\\n    echo $fruitArrayItem.\\\"\\\\n\\\";\\n}\\n?>\\napple,banana,cherry\\napple\\nbanana\\ncherry\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Along similar lines, if we want to check if a string matches a pattern, we can use preg_match(), and if we want to search and replace, we can use preg_replace().
