It's a great package that makes it really easy to dynamically generate images on the fly. For instance, if you need a particular image at both a thumbnail size and a full-screen size, it means you have the flexibility to request it at the correct size for any one part of the page. This can potentially save bandwidth since you never have to request a larger image than you technically need and scale it down with HTML attributes or CSS, nor do you have to take steps to generate thumbnails separately before they're needed. Frontend developers can adjust their code to request exactly the version they need at any one time, and can even apply certain effects dynamically.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"However, by default it's a bit too open. A malicious user could request an image at an excessive size as part of a denial of service attack. For that reason, it's considered good practice to set a maximum image size, and sign all requests so that you can be sure they're authorized by your application. This works fine if your images are being requested somewhere you can sign them easily, such as in a Blade template. However, doing so in the context of a React or Vue application can potentially be much harder because they're working on the front end and so can't sign requests that are made dynamically in the same way, at least not without you exposing your application's key to the front end, which would be \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"really\"), \" risky. An API endpoint can return URLs for pre-signed specific versions of the image, but that's not as flexible as being able to adjust what you get back via query parameters on the fly.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I'm currently working on an application that uses GraphQL for the API, and for that I wanted to use Glide to enable \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images\"\n  }, \"responsive images\"), \" and minimise the size of the payload. Having recently rewritten this blog in Gatsby, I'd had some exposure to the Sharp plugin, which allows you to query for an image at specific dimensions. It struck me that I could probably do something similar with GraphQL in the context of a Laravel application. Since the GraphQL queries that would return the image URLs and other data were being handled server side, they could in theory accept parameters for the required images, validate that the specified values were acceptable, and return a secure, signed URL for that image for consumption by the front end. Since the frontend was having to make an AJAX request to fetch the items to show anyway, it could request the URLs as part of the same AJAX request as the rest of the items on a page, then render the images along with the rest of the content. Here I'll demonstrate how to do this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The first thing to do is implement a controller for returning images via Glide.
