Early on, Gatsby looked like the strongest candidate since it used React, offered a GraphQL-based abstraction layer for easier querying, had a rich ecosystem of plugins for common functionality, and was highly performant, but I made about three attempts to rebuild my site in it which petered out over time. Then, earlier this year I decided to start over and had a lot more success. I did struggle a bit getting a halfway decent design, and for a while pivoted to trying to build it with Next.js instead - this was ultimately abandoned because without the GraphQL abstraction layer, a lot of the querying became a real chore, but I did ultimately decide to port the appearance of that over to the Gatsby site.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the things that made this particular implementation the one that stuck was \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://mdxjs.com/\"\n  }, \"MDX\"), \". If you're not familiar with it, it's a superset of Markdown that lets you include JSX in your content, allowing for easy addition of reusable UI components within page and blog post content. Also, building it in Typescript was a good call - I'd been sticking with Flow for several years, but unfortunately it's looking like Flow has fallen by the wayside and Typescript has become the only realistic typed solution for Javascript developers, so I felt it was time to adopt that. I've also enjoyed how easy Tailwind was to use (implementing dark mode was really simple), and have been able to implement JSON feeds as well as the standard RSS and Atom ones.
