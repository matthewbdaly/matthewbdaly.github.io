This means it only needs to change what actually changes, making it faster than other client-side templating systems.

That means that that part needs to be listening all the time, not just when someone is using the app. Also, it doesn't fit neatly into the usual request-response cycle - if several people visit the site at once, we could end up with multiple connections to fetch the same data, which is really not efficient, and could cause problems with duplicate tweets showing up.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Instead, we'll have a separate \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"worker.js\"), \" file which runs constantly.

In theory, this would also allow you to scale your app more easily by allowing movement of different tasks to different servers, and several app servers could interface with a single worker process.
