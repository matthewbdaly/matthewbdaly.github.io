I was pretty pleased about this as having been something of an Android early adopter, I was still using an early Android phone, namely my HTC Magic.

Ideally I didn't want to change my plan, so I checked out the deals for HTC phones on the same plan, and the Desire Z happened to be the only one on the same plan, so it was a no-brainer.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I got the phone on Monday, and it is amazing. The keyboard is easy to use and works well, the phone is lightning fast, and the UI is spot-on - it has everything I love about Android on the Magic (like the great notification system) and more.
