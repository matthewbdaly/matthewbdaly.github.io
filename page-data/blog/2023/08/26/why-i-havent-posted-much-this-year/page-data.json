If you visit many PHP or web development-related communities, such as the PHP subreddit, it's quite common for inexperienced developers to post questions along the lines of \\\"What is the fastest framework?\\\". A lot of barely-more experienced commenters will then leap in with ill-informed comments about which frameworks are supposedly slower or faster, based on benchmarks. In actual fact, the idea of a framework being faster or slower really doesn't make sense - a framework isn't an application, the way something like WordPress is, and to compare the same \\\"Hello world\\\" application implemented in different frameworks gives a really poor idea of what the real reasons for poor application performance are. The actual causes of a slow application are nearly always something that isn't framework specific, and rewriting a working application into a supposedly \\\"faster\\\" framework won't generally resolve the issue.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And that, in a nutshell, is why I've created \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://highperformancelaravel.com/\"\n  }, \"High Performance Laravel\"), \".
