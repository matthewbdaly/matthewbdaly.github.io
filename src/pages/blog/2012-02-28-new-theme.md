For a long time now, I've kept meaning to write my own WordPress theme from scratch for this site, but just haven't been able to find the time to do so. Now, I've finally found the time to do so, and here it is!

Please let me know what you think, but be gentle (this is my first solo WordPress theme, and also the only one I've built completely from scratch), and if you find any issues with it please let me know. Don't expect it to look great in IE6 or IE7 however - I've given it a very cursory review in those browsers, and that's all. It's still perfectly readable, but it uses a fair amount of CSS3 so it's inevitably not going to look as pretty in those browsers.

The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/matthewbdaly/Steel-Age) if you want to take a look.
