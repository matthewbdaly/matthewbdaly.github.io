I'm glad to report that today I passed my CIW JavaScript Fundamentals exam with 98%! I was a bit concerned about this as some of the questions on the practice exam were downright wrong (as in the supposedly correct answers were in fact wrong), but thankfully this turned out not to be the case for the actual exam.

Next step is learning Perl. I'm particularly interested to learn more about Perl because it's something you can get a lot of use out of - it can be used for regular expressions, general Unix scripting and web development, and I'm interested to see how it compares to Python.
