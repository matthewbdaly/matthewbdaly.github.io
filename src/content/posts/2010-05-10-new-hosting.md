I've now gone and switched to paid hosting, and have dumped the old static site in favour of a Wordpress-powered blog on my own domain. I've found Wordpress to be an extremely flexible and powerful solution, far superior to Blogger, and I'm really excited about the possibilities of a self-hosted blog, so I'm really looking forward to establishing myself here! At some point I intend to create a custom theme of my own, but for now this one will do fine!

As I mentioned previously, I've changed the emphasis of the blog towards web development. I've also now made a number of other improvements - comments are now powered by Disqus, to facilitate easier sharing of posts and making it easier for people to reply to me via blog posts of their own.

Enjoy!
