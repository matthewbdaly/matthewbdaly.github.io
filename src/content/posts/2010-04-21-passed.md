Today I took the exam for my CIW Database Design Specialist course, and I'm pleased to say that I passed with flying colours! I find it hard to believe that I've managed to actually accumulate that much information about relational databases, but somehow I did it!

Now to actually get out of my existing customer services role and into the IT industry! I'm still studying as I've got a lot more work to do for the rest of my CIW Master Enterprise Developer certification, but this means I've got a lot more options open to me - database administration's a possibility but really I'm more interested in web development. I've got to study JavaScript next, then Perl, then PHP and classic ASP before moving on to Java.
