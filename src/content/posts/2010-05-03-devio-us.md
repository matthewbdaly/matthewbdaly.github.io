For a while now I've been looking for a good free shell account provider, and the other day I stumbled across the best I've ever seen at [http://devio.us/](http://devio.us/). They run OpenBSD, they provide pretty much everything you could want from a shell account provider, and they've been very willing to help so far - when I asked if they had plans to add Python support, they added it within 24 hours. If you're looking for a good shell account provider, I suggest you give them a try.
