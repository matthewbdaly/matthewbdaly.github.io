Here's another simple Perl program I thought I'd share. It's a very simple app for recording notes from the shell. As pasting the last one into WordPress didn't work too well, [it's on my Dropbox account](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5031/notable.pl) instead. I've used SQLite as the backend for the database (a no-brainer - I really like SQLite for little quick-and-dirty scripts like this) and it works pretty well.

At some point I may go back to this basic concept and expand on it a little - it would make sense to add a GUI to it, either by using a graphical toolkit such as Tk or turning it into a web app. I also like the idea of adapting it to use a non-relational database - something like CouchDB perhaps.
