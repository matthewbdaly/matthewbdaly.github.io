You can contact me with this form, but please bear in mind the following:

* This is strictly a personal blog, and I'm not interested in posting guest posts, so please don't ask. Nor am I interested in letting you rebuild it.
* I'm also not interested in reviewing commercial products unless they're directly useful to me in my work. Given I don't generally get on with graphical IDE's, *please* don't ask me to review your PHP IDE - even if I were to say yes, I won't have a good experience with it, and my review will reflect that.
