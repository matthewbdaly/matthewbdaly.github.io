I'm a web (and occasional mobile app) developer based in Norfolk in the UK.

I've worked extensively with a number of technologies, including the following:

* Laravel
* Django
* Zend 1
* Next.js
* Gatsby.js
* Drupal
* Wordpress
* Statamic
* React.js
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

I blog regularly about web development, particularly about Django, Laravel and Node.js, and have also [written for Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/mdaly/). Outside of work and extra-curricular coding I'm a huge fan of *Firefly* and *Archer*, and have spent *way* too much time lately playing *No Man's Sky*, *Subnautica* (both the original and *Below Zero*) and *Mass Effect: Legendary Edition*. I've also begun developing an appreciation of Guinness and Brewdog's range of ales (Dead Pony Club is my favourite).
