I blog regularly about web development, particularly about Django, Laravel and Node.js, and have also [written for Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/mdaly/). Outside of work and extra-curricular coding I'm a huge fan of *Firefly* and *Archer*, and have spent *way* too much time lately playing *No Man's Sky*, *Subnautica* (both the original and *Below Zero*) and *Mass Effect: Legendary Edition*. I've also begun developing an appreciation of Guinness and Brewdog's range of ales (Dead Pony Club is my favourite).

Contacting me
-------------

You can contact me with the form below, but please bear the following in mind:

* This is strictly a personal blog, and I'm not interested in posting guest posts, so please don't ask. Nor am I interested in letting you rebuild it.
* I'm also not interested in reviewing commercial products unless they're directly useful to me in my work. Given I don't generally get on with graphical IDE's, *please* don't ask me to review your PHP IDE - even if I were to say yes, I won't have a good experience with it, and my review will reflect that.
